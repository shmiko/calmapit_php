      <Name>Museum of Glass</Name>
      <Description>It began in August, 1992 in the course of a conversation between two friends, Phil Phibbs, who had recently retired as president of the University of Puget Sound and artist Dale Chihuly who had grown up in a neighborhood near the campus and had attended the university. Dr. Phibbs suggested that Tacoma should have a glass museum. He reasoned that artists from the Pacific Northwest had played a major role in the Studio Glass movement as it developed around the world.</Description>

This igneous rock has an elevation of 235 feet (72 m) and is often accessible at low tide, especially in the summertime.

    <Description>Tiger Mountain is a mountain in the U.S. state of Washington. The mountain has six peaks in the center of the Issaquah Alps forming a 13,500-acre triangle between Interstate 90 on the north.</Description>
    <Address>From Issaquah head east on Front Street (which becomes Issa-quah-Hobart Road after it leaves town). About 6 miles past the city limits, turn left (north) onto SE Tiger Mountain Road. Continue for 1/4 mile before parking on the left shoulder at a wide pullout. The trail is on the right, up the road a hundred feet or so from the pullout.</Address>

    <Name>Wild Horses Monument</Name>
    <Description> Artist David Govedare’s life size sculptures, added during Washington State's Centennial Celebration, are entitled Grandfather Cuts Loose the Ponies. Hoping to capture the mystical spirits of a time that has passed, this 200 foot line of steel ponies remind us all of time when creatures were able to roam wild and free.</Description>
    <Address>From Ellensburg drive east on Interstate 90 to exit 139 (just after crossing the Columbia River). The exit, signed "Scenic Viewpoint," leads to a large parking area. In winter, park at the closed gate and walk in. In any season, though, stop here for a quiet, relaxing, hour-long break when traveling across the state on I-90.</Address>

    <Name>Palouse Falls</Name>
    <Description>Its size and splendor make Palouse Falls one of the most scenic and impressive waterfalls in all of Washington, but its location adds even more magic and wonder to its image.</Description>
    <Address>From Dayton, drive US 12 north for 14 miles. Turn left on State Route 261 and continue through the tiny community of Starbuck (sorry, the only coffee here is usually day-old Hills Brothers at the small cafe). You'll also pass Lyons Ferry Park at 14.7 miles. At 20.5 miles from US 12, turn right onto Palouse Falls Road signed "Palouse Falls State Park--2." Drive down the hill 2.4 miles to enter the park and to park.</Address>
