Objects in the Solar System (other than the Sun) should use the \"absolute magnitude\" property on the type \"Star System Object\", since it is a different measurement."},{"name":"Color Index","id":"\/astronomy\/celestial_object\/color_index","expected_type":"\/type\/float","description":"The color index is a simple numerical expression that determines the color of an object, which in the case of a star gives its temperature. To measure the index, one observes the magnitude of an object successively through two different filters, such as U and B, or B and V, where U is sensitive to ultraviolet rays, B is sensitive to blue light, and V is sensitive to visible (green-yellow) light."},{"name":"Hipparcos Catalog Number","id":"\/astronomy\/celestial_object\/hipparcos_catalog_number","expected_type":"\/type\/int","description":"This catalog contains 118,218 stars that were observed by the European Space Agency's Hipparcos Satellite from late 1989 to 1993.

Declination in astronomy is comparable to geographic latitude, but projected onto the celestial sphere. Declination is measured in degrees north and south of the celestial equator. Points north of the celestial equator have positive declinations, while those to the south have negative declinations. Please enter as a decimal value for the degree value."},{"name":"Right Ascension","id":"\/astronomy\/celestial_object\/right_ascention","expected_type":"\/type\/float","description":"Right ascension is the celestial equivalent of terrestrial longitude. Both right ascension and longitude measure an angle that increases toward the east as measured from a zero point on an equator. For longitude, the zero point is the Prime Meridian on the geographic equator; for right ascension, the zero point is known as the first point of Aries, which is the place in the sky where the Sun crosses the celestial equator at the March equinox. The value entered should be the decimal equivalent of degrees."}],"included_types":[{"name":"Topic","id":"\/common\/topic"}]}
