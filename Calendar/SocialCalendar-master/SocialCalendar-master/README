SocialCalendar adds an event list to Full Calendar.  
https://github.com/arshaw/fullcalendar

DONE:

Events spanning multiple days are automatically displayed on each day they occur.

Examples:

Event List View
http://grantpark.org/core/event/calendar.aspx?show=list&mode=a

Monthly Calendar View
http://grantpark.org/core/event/calendar.aspx?mode=a

TO DO:

$100 Project:
1. Copy HTML and Javascript from page above to GitHub. (Optional: Remove unrelated HTML.)
2. Update JavaScript to toggle between Event List and calendar view without reloading feed.
3. Create a means to load multiple json feeds into the same calendar.
4. Load holidays from Google using JSONP. Sample: http://arshaw.com/js/fullcalendar-1.5.3/demos/gcal.html
5. Load friend events from Facebook. (Loren has a sample.)
6. Display a different color for each data source.

Note that the Google and Facebook event feeds will have a different syntax.  Either include a parameter indicating which syntax to use for each feed specified, or detect each feed's syntax automatically. 

Contact Loren if you are interested in making the six updates above for $100.
