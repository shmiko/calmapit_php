/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Buy Disposable Phone
      and investigate GPS.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Afternoon
      Shopping:</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Went to Westfield
      in Century City, we were looking for shoes thinking there would be bargains
      stores, as well we needed Coffee and some food stuffs etc. Most shops were
      shut.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Santa Monica Pier
      4-8m (15m Drive) by Limo.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Santa Monica is
      awesome, you arrive via crowded LA streets to a corner on top of a hill
      overlooking the pier and surrounding beaches.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It is very
      crowded but not cars as they get stopped just before the pier. But there are
      people everywhere.<br />
      There is a theme park here called Pacific Fair and lots of side show
      attractions, each begging a slightly different payment, whether it be a dollar
      or a donation nothing is free. We bought Lilia a beautiful cream hat, it is so
      trendy and she looks so cool in it. The man who sold the hat needed to take his
      wireless EFTPOS machine away and off he walked, I through he was a goner but he
      did stop to process the payment and gave our card back. Jack and I bought a
      Santa Monica cap also.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We saw our first
      penny machine where they crush a penny with an imprint of a selected souvenir
      picture, we got 3, the kids and I picked one each. We walked down to the
      Pacific Fair park, Jack and I went on the roller coaster twice, we all went on
      the Ferris wheel which was great, despite having very open carriages and making
      me so nervous that the kids would stand up to look over and they would rock and
      roll over and out they would go.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We finished
      having some fun here and grabbed a coffee and hot chocolate at a coffee shop
      called Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf, the coffee was excellent, Wendy, Jack and
      Lilia had a hot chocolate.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We went to
      Tijuana for the day, what a bloody disaster.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We hired a car, a
      little Kia Soul and drove down to the border; it took about 2 hours to get
      there.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>On the way we
      stopped at a rest stop where the kids were able to feed some squirrels, which was
      excellent.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We arrived at the
      border around 11am, walked across the border and entered Mexico without any
      hassles.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>However the state
      of Tijuana is very different to what i remember 20 years ago, it is like a
      ghost town, no tourists at all, in fact we were pretty much the only ones
      anywhere.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It was a little
      scary to be honest, we felt like walking targets for every Mexican trying to
      peddle their goods. We bought lots of things and after about 2 hours walking
      around what Jack called an &quot;Intellectual Wasteland&quot;.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>On the way we
      happened to notice a line of people that extended for about 2 km, they were
      waiting to cross the border back to the US, we were fortunate enough to be told
      that we could catch a bus for $5 and cross the border to avoid lining up for
      what was going to take 4 hours.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well the bus
      turned out to be just as bad and we sat waiting for the bus to move for over an
      hour, finally we got to customs but stood waiting for another 45 minutes, why
      we still don't know why it was such a long wait, no one could explain, no
      wonder there are no tourists, the border control is so disorganized and just
      shameful.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>When we got
      across we drove back only to get lost twice, this turned out to be a very long
      drive back to the hotel. We got back 9pm. We are all stuffed.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We did have an
      experience though, and I'm glad the kids get to appreciate what we take for
      granted. Well see the photos for proof of total poverty. I was asked not to  take
      photos, but of course I had to, so most photos were taken without looking
      through the camera, but holding waste high and hoping for the best, so the
      photos might be a little skew if.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Arrived in NY at
      4:30pm, got picked up by pre-arranged shuttle at 5:30 due to driver waiting at
      wrong terminal, we were the only ones left standing in the terminal, so at
      least he was able to see us easily - funnily though he was walking towards us
      with the sign held high in the air for nobody but us to see, it was pretty
      obvious we were the waiting party.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Left my phone on
      the shuttle, which we are having returned to us tonight.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We walked around
      Time Square and went to look at Rockefeller Centre and then up to the top of
      the Empire State Building, we got an express pass and bypassed about 200 people
      waiting, we got to go straight up without lining up.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The temperature
      was in the minus and was so cold it was almost impossible to hold the camera to
      take photos, but i did. We quickly walked around the outside of level 86 with
      full night views across NY - pretty spectacular, not surprising though I don't
      remember any of this from when we came here in 1980.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Was a very late
      night getting back from night shopping, about 11pm, needed a late night Mac
      Attack but took 30 minutes to line up at the Time Square Macc's, the crowds are
      just phenomenal, everywhere you go there is a massive line.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Finding it very
      difficult to get a nice cup of coffee though.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>And of all things
      I have the bloody flu - hoping not to contract the New Work flu which is
      apparently at epidemic levels, fingers crossed.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Everyone is
      having a great time and we absolutely love New York - the atmosphere in Times Square
      is incredible, and just wait to see some of the photos.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Had a big sleep
      in today as the kids were very sleep deprived, so a late start at 10am.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Went to the
      Nintendo store, Lego store and the largest toy store in the world and then went
      looking for the One Direction store for Lilia but unfortunately it had closed.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Jack got lots
  &nbsp;of Pokemon, he has also bought gifts for all of his school mates. Lilia
      got some Lego friend sets and lots of clothes.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We also saw the
      ice skating rink last night and today but no skaters, both times they were
      cleaning and preparing the surface, but still quite amazing, I do remember this
      from when i was a kid.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Went on the
      subway a few times now, so getting used to their metro - it's actually very
      good - kids travel free also.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Went down to the
      Statue of Liberty - no tour as we were content in seeing it from afar.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We also walked
      down the the World Trade Memorial, very sad and humbling, huge crowds to see
      the official remembrance memorial but we didn't line up as we felt it was more
      for those who had lost loved ones.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It's 4pm now and
      were having a quick break before heading out again in an hour or so, we'll try

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Going to try and
      catch up with my mate Julz tomorrow - he lives in New Jersey but the timing
      might make it difficult as he is overseas until this evening, so will play by
      ear. Julz is a Yello collector and I have known him for over 10 years now so
      would be great to catch up.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Also plan to get

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Last day in New
      York - Went to Central Park and to another special one of a kind toy shop.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Love New York.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Left New York and
      arrived on time in Orlando.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Checked into
      Ramada - but within 10 minutes the experience wasn't good.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>None of the taxi
      drivers have spoken a single word, quite rude in fact.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The Ramada staff
      are appalling and lack any common courtesy at all.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We we left lining
      up to check in for 30 minutes whilst the 2 counter staff let other people just
      cut in front. They then gave us a room at the furthest room from reception - by
      this time it's 10pm and the kids were way over tired and to know we had to lug
      6 bags without any ported help wasn't something we were overly happy about. The
      girl suggested she would find a trolley but actually didn't bother so it was up
      to us to find one, which we did but when we finally got to our room the door
      would not open, after going all the way back to reception they said you had to
      lift the door to enter, when in actual fact the door handle worked in reverse
      and needed tilting up to open, yet from the inside it was normal. After getting
      settled we went to get some food at the restaurant, only to be told that a
      cheese burger will take an hour to cook as they were under staffed, well
      needless to say we didn't wait and walked over to Macca's again</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The room was
      pretty poor as well.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Anyway we only
      needed to stay 1 night so we just bit our lip and waited for the next morning
      when we would leave bright and early to pick up the RV, well that was the
      plan...read on to find out what happened next.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Checked out of
      the crappy Ramada as soon as possible and caught a taxi to the RV pickup.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The RV is only
      months old and has all the bells and whistles we could want, it's a big rig
      though and only just fits on the road, I keep getting told i am too close to
      the left - most likely has something to do with driving on the other side of
      the road. Anyway we got the RV and decided that it was just too rushed now to
      get to the Kennedy Centre so we will do that on day 7.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Only took 45
      minutes to get to Disney World Fort Wilderness, drove up and our RV was pretty
      much the smallest, there were some huge RV's with cars being towed behind, i
      wouldn't like to be driving them.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Got checked in
      and all went nicely - first time there were no hiccups. We are staying in an
      area of the park called &quot;Jack Rabbit Run&quot;, getting the RV hooked up
      was interesting, there is so much to consider, but we got there.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The kids had some
      fun at the pool play area before we decided to head over to Magic Kingdom for
      the evening. It bought back so many memories and was such an awesome moment
      when we arrived at the gates by boat. Yep that right, the place we are staying
      is a Disney Resort and as such they have direct access to the parks, to get to
      the Magic Kingdom you need to catch a boat and it was so awesome seeing the
      kids faces light up when we arrived at the entrance.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Low and behold it
      turned out that the reception did make a booboo and gave us someone else's
      entry card to Disneyworld, so off to customer relations to sort it out, oh well
      nothing is meant to be that easy anyway is it?&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We got inside
      after a short while and headed straight for Cinderella's castle, Lilia was in
      her element and had to have a Cinderella costume, so she did, she spent some of
      her money and bought the dress and gloves to match but unfortunately the shoes
      were not in her size. Jack got a Mickey mouse shirt also.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We went to the
      haunted castle, it was so good and i think i actually remember some of it, but
      crikey it's hard taking photos in such darkness whilst you are moving, so not
      too many pictures of this ride.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We tried to watch
      the magical parade but the crowds were just overwhelming and it wasn't really
      possible, to top it off I got separated from Wendy and the kids and had to wait
      until after the parade to try to find them, it was 30 minutes of anxiousness.
      After the parade we finally found each other and headed over to some more
      shops, upon exiting the last shop they announced the fireworks at the castle
      were going to start, so we enjoyed them and headed back home on the boat.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The best wildlife
      spotting was when Jack spotted what we think is an Amridillo - in fact it has
      since been confirmed, pretty cool. You can see the pictures i got, as well
      there are heaps of little squirrels around which are just lovely to look at.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well tomorrow we
      are off to Epcot at 7am as we have a couple of hours to get into the park
      before it opens, this is a benefit of staying at a Disney resort, called early
      hours, they also have them at night up until 3am sometimes - not that we would
      stay out that late.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Tonight i was
      finally able to call home - got to speak to Mum and Ross just briefly but it

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Up at 6am and
      caught bus at 7am to Epcot.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We arrived before
      opening for Magic Hours but unfortunately we got there and everything we had
      earmarked was closed so we wasted our magic hours - not too happy about that
      as&nbsp;we had been expecting the whole park to be open like the other 3, but
      no Epcot has half the place shut until 10 or 11, so we didn't get to take
      advantage of any fast passes&nbsp;but will plan on returning.We did a few
      things whilst we were there including a ride called Space Mission to Mars -
      this is a virtual ride where we are 4 crew aboard a spaceship heading for Mars,
      we&nbsp;each had a part to play which involved pushing buttons at the right
      time in order to complete the mission, it was quite a hair raising experience
      and this unfortunately made&nbsp;Wendy feel sick for the remainder of the day -
      so much so she couldn't go on any more rides for fear of more motion sickness.
      Jack and I loved it though.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Just prior to
      this we got 4 fast passes for a ride called test track, so Jack and I went on
      it twice in a row, it was great. Again a simulated ride where we got to design
      a&nbsp;fast car and compete with other riders, at the end of the race the
      results were posted on screen for all to see, we then sent the whole video of
      our race back home by email&nbsp;for us to enjoy when we return. It was
      excellent fun.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We also made time
      for some character greetings, specifically Mickey, Pluto and Minnie Mouse and
      got really nice close up photos of the kids.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We had
      reservations at Animal Kingdom in a restaurant called Rainforest Cafe, this
      place simulates different tropical weather conditions which made for a
      different&nbsp;experience, the layout and design was quite amazing and there
      was always something happening and made for a great atmosphere. The lunches
      were amazing too.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>This took a
      couple of hours and we didn't actually enter the Animal Kingdom park as we'll
      be doing that on Wednesday 4th.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We caught the bus
      home and had had a swim in the pool and relaxed for a while before heading back
      over to Magic Kingdom to see the nighttime Electrical Parade and
      fireworks.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>This was just
      incredible and well worth a late night. We did catch a little the night before
      but this was when i got lost so we really didn't experience it like we
      did&nbsp;tonight.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Back home for bed
      at about 11:30pm, kids and both Wendy and I are stuffed and ready for a good

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Up at 9am (
      missed out on Early extra hours as we were all just so exhausted ) but arrived
      there about 10:30 and as usual the crowds were just ridiculous.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The first stop
      was to watch Star Wars Padawan Training, Jacks wants to do this so badly but
      the booking are all taken before the pack opens so god only knows how people
      manage&nbsp;it, but we certainly will be trying again for Jack. We got some
      fast pass tickets to the Star Wars Tours show which is basically a virtual ride,
      we couldn't go back to this&nbsp;ride for another hour or so, so it's off to
      see something else whilst we wait.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We went to see
      the Action Stunt Show called Light's Camera Action, this was absolutely
      thrilling and involves a movie set in a small French town where there is a bit
      of a gun&nbsp;fight with cars and motor bikes doing crazy stunts with
      explosions etc, it was worth it, we managed to get given fast passes from a
      lady at the front, otherwise the line up&nbsp;was over an hour.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The stadium where
      it is holds about 500 people and by the time the show started there were still
      people walking in who had been waiting without fast passes,&nbsp;they likley
      didn't even get a seat. The show was excellent and very exciting, we all loved
      it.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>After this myself
      and Jack went to the Star Wars Tour, whilst Wendy and Lilia went shopping, the
      ride is a virtual ride where we all sit in a bid room with seat belts to hold&nbsp;you
      in and then the big screen in front is 3D and propels you through space
      avoiding meteors and other space ships from the star wars movies, all of which
      Jack knew very well&nbsp;so ofcourse he loved it very much, the ride was fast
      and would have made Wendy and Lilia feel sick from the motion and sudden turns
      and drops but Jack and I love it.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>After this we
      went to see the exhibition called Honey I Shrunk My Kids, it an interactive
      play aear for kids ( and some adults too ) where the kids wander through an area
      with&nbsp;giant sized ants and bees and dogs noses, tunnels, spider webs to
      crawl through, the kids loved it and had some&nbsp;good play time.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We stopped by the
      writers guild shop and i bought this beautiful book on Disney world, fat to
      nice to open here so I must wait until I get home to see it, one of those
      big&nbsp;heavey books so this will no doubt add a little to our excess baggage
      charges.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We then had some
      lunch and went onto to see the Disney Movie Back lot Tour, this is a tour of
      the actual Disney Movie Studios and Set building areas, costume designs and
      Props&nbsp;area, very interesting and well worth it, despite have a technical
      breakdown and having to wait an extra 20 minutes in line.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We tried to see
      the Indiana Jones Stunt show but each time we tried it was standing room only,
      the kids were so tired it just wouldn't have been any fun for them or us so
      we&nbsp;have put it off until another day when we will return for extra magic
      hours and get some of these rides and shows done early or at least get fast
      passes.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The designs of
      the Hollywood Studios is excellent with areas painted to look like real City's
      such as San Fran and New York all painted onto flat boards but very realistic.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We then decided
      to head back home for some diner as we had plans to see a night show at Fort
      Wilderness. The bus ride home took about an hour which meant we were home an
      hour&nbsp;or so before the show started. We all hired two canoes and went canoeing
      down the Disney rivers for about 45 minutes, it was very hard work as we were
      going against a small&nbsp;tide for most of the time, i had never canoed before
      so it took me some time to get used to it, yes i crashed into the side of the
      river bank a couple of times which the kids&nbsp;thought was very funny. Wendy
      and the kids had previously done canoeing in Vanuatu so they had some
      experience.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>When we finished
      we headed back to the RV for a quick shower and dinner before tonight’s show
      and movie.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Jack and I went
      and got some take away at the closest resort restaurant and by the time we got
      back ( yes there are crowds even at Fort Wilderness waiting to eat - you
      just&nbsp;can't avoid the wait everywhere you go ) we had missed the start of
      the Campfire Marshmallow cooking, sing-a-long and seeing Chip and Dale, but
      fortunately we hadn't missed&nbsp;much and arrived to see the area pretty
      packed out with resort guests The atmosphere was excellent, everyone was
      singing along to a man singing US country favourites, Wendy&nbsp;even managed
      to put her hand up when the singer asked the crowd where other people were
      from, she said Australia, at this time Jack, Lilia and myself had gone up the
      back to&nbsp;get a photo with Chip-n-Dale and we heard the crowd acknowledge
      Australia, but at the time we didn't know it was because of Wendy.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The kids got to
      toast some marshmallow, had a sing along, but we passed on the nights movie and
      headed off to bed hoping to enable an early start.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Up at 8am.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Arrived by boat
      to see Disneyworld at crowd capacity, the crowds are quite incredible.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We have learnt
      that nothing happens quickly here and you need to allow hours for just a single
      attraction, so we took advantage of our fast pass and got a ticket for the
      Jungle Cruise, whilst waiting for that we lined up for the Rocky Mountain
      Railroad ( One that Mum you will remember because you went on it at least twice
      when we were here many years ago), the wait was about 45  minutes but there are
      many little things to keep the crowds entertained whilst waiting, most of which
      are interactive and certainly makes the wait more enjoyable. The ride was just
      as much fun as i remember, Wendy was able to enjoy this as well Lilia loved it,
      no need to mention the fact that Jack and I loved it so much too. After this we
      went and got a fast pass ticket to Splash Mountain but we couldn't return for
      two hours, so we had some lunch and walked through some shops. By 1pm when we
      returned for our ride the line was up to 180 minutes wait, before entering
      Wendy went and got fat passes for Peter Pans ride ( another one of the most
      popular rides which the wait was over 2 hours for and the earliest fat pass
      time to return was at 7pm. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We proceeded
      through and shortly we had boarded ready for Splash Mountain (we expected to
      get quite wet as this was the mentioned before you boarded) so I had my camera
      covered up and used Wendy's little one. Funnily enough the ride had technical
      difficulties and we were stuck at the very top just peering over the big drop,
      we were stuck for about 15 minutes whilst they figured the problem, finally we
      dropped over the ledged for a fast dive into water and yes there was a big
      splash but it was nice. The best past was that we were given 4 free fast passes
      to use at any attraction due to the wait we had endured, so all in all it was
      well worth it. Upon exiting the ride the wait time was now over 3 hours.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We decided to try
      and get another ride in as it is so difficult with the crowds to see and do
      everything so we had to pick what we could do in the time we had taking into
      account the waits. We headed over to Space Mountain and Jack and I went through
      with our free passes and avoided a 2 hour line up, this ride was super-fast in
      pitch blackness but it was so much fun, we will do this again tonight when we
      return for the 2nd lot of rides that we have planned. After Space Mountain we
      went and got 2 more lots of fast passes to coincide with tonight’s return trip,
      so we now have planned for tonight to see Peter Pan, Winnie the Pooh and Ariel
      under Sea adventure, we need to return by 6:30pm to fit everything in, it will
      most likely be another late night.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It's now 4pm and
      we have a couple of hours to relax before heading back tonight, the kids and
      over swimming whilst i try to catch up on our travel logs, after 3 days it's
      not easy remembering all the things we do as we fit so much into each day.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The squirrels are
      everywhere and Jack and I have secret planned to bring home at least 5 each,
      they are just so lovely and cute little critters, just like little kittens, so
      very playful running around and doing little somersaults. There are also some
      of the most beautiful little bright red birds which kind of look like
      woodpeckers but I’m not exactly sure.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We caught the
      boat back over at 6:30 as planned and this time we had fast passes for
      everything we wanted to do, it would be tight to fit them all in but this is
      the only way we get to see the things we had planned on, otherwise you just
      miss too much.We first went and saw Winnie the Pooh, it a short ride with loads
      of color and was very well done, this was mostly for Lilia as she had missed
      out on a few rides that Jack and I got to do so it was only fair she got a few
      special rides too. Lilia really enjoyed it too which was nice to see.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>After this we had
      to 30 minutes to wait until the next rides time was due so we decided to
      squeeze in a couple of extra activities. The first was the Swiss Family
      Robinson Tree house - this was a huge tree about 5 stories high and had lots of
      props from the movie, climbing roped stair and crossing swinging bridges the
      kids and both Wendy and I enjoyed it thoroughly.There was still time before the
      next ride so we really wanted to see the Pirates of the Caribbean. Although we
      couldn't get a fast pass the wait was only 30 minutes so we took a punt and
      went for it hoping we wouldn't run short of time to get to the net attraction,
      we just made it through and it was fantastic, although very hard to take photos
      as it was so dark and there is no flash photography allowed, but i still
      managed to get quite a few pictures anyway ( without flash ) , i seem to
      remember some of this but perhaps i am mistaken not sure if it was here when we
      came or not.When it finished we had to hurry to get to the next ride which
      again was mostly for Lilia and it was called Ariel Undersea Adventure, this was
      a beautifully decorated ride where Lilia practically told the whole story as we
      went through the ride, she loved it.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We were now ready
      to enter the most popular attraction in Disneyworld, this is Peter Pans Flying
      Adventure - this was a slow paced ride flying over the most beautiful painted
      scenes and animated characters, again this was excellent but in my opinion it
      wouldn't be worthy of a 3 hour wait and i feel it was a bit overrated, Wendy
      tended to disagree and thought it was well worth it, I know Lilia thought the
      same, Jack was probably impartial but enjoyed it still.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well it was about
      8pm by now and we had covered off more than we had planned, so far this was the
      most successful part of our Disney trip but we still had time for one more ride
      - this was for Jack and I to go back to Space Mountain for the 2nd time and use
      up the free fast passes we got earlier in the day, so we went straight past the
      crowds who had been waiting for over 2 hours to ride, we were very lucky. It
      was just amazing and even better the 2nd time.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>it's time to get
      home, and the parade on main street is just starting so the task of exiting the
      park is a huge task as the crowd are crazy and there are so many rude people
      with these huge double prams who just block the whole pathway. We got turned
      back to a different exit after walking for 10 minutes only to have to back
      track the way we came, anyway we finally got out and managed to get back to
      line up for the boat ride home, we were also lucky to retrieve Jack LA hat that
      he had lost on the way home earlier today, the boat captain kept it for us,
      that was another bit of luck.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Back home and
      straight to bed for the kids as I need to wake then at 6am tomorrow as we plan
      to get to the Animal Kingdom Park for Magic Hours tomorrow.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>I have taken over
      1400 photos in the last 3 days so I just cannot upload them all, the other
      night I uploaded 2 days’ worth and it took me until 2am, i was up at 6am the
      next day and have been getting very little sleep so I will wait for some more
      time to upload the photos. The other thing is that keeping the batteries
      charged is a bit of a challenge as all cameras and laptop is getting a huge
      workout. You'll be pleased to know I haven't looked at work email since leaving
      LA, which feels really nice like a proper break away; I do get a little worried
      for my team members though.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <h1><a name="_Toc380399341" id="_Toc380399341">Day 10 - Wednesday 3rd April  Animal Kingdom</a></h1>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We have the whole
      day at Animal Kingdom today. Arrived nice and early for Magic Hours at 8am on
      the dot, only to be told that Magic Hours had already finished and the park was
      now open to the public - so yet again we didn't get to take advantage of Magic
      Hours. Magic Hours are intended to give resort guests early and late access to
      the parks before opening and after closing, well the night time hours go until
      3am which is too late for us so we have aimed for the early sessions, so far
      not much luck though.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Anyway the crowds
      were fortunately nothing like Epcot the other day and was manageable. We went
      straight to the ride called Kali Rapids and got a fast pass to return in an
      hour or so, the wait was only 10 minutes but it's a very wet ride so we
      preferred to wait until the sun was out and was a little warmer. We went for a
      wander and popped in to see a 4D movie - this involves 3D movies but with
      movement in seats and smells being sprayed at the audience, being the first 4D
      experience it was quite amazing, we all enjoyed it and it was only about 10
      minutes in duration so didn't take up a huge amount of time. We can only get 1
      fast pass every 2 hours so careful planning is required to get through all
      things.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>There was another
      hugely popular attraction called Kilimanjaro Jungle Safari which by now was
      already sitting at an 80 minute wait, and yes there were hundreds of people
      lined up for that long to go on it, Wendy suggested we wait but i was opposed
      to lining up for so long and felt we could do other things instead and return
      later to get a fast pass to avoid lining up.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Jack and I
      grabbed a little breakfast snack to eat whilst we walked around.We went looking
      at the various animal exhibits and got some great photos of different animal
      species. It was now time for the rapids ride, the sign upon entering warns the
      participants that it is likely you will get wet, or even soaked, so i was
      prepared as i still had on a windcheater jacket which kept me mostly dry, but
      for Wendy, Jack and Lilia that had removed their jackets so as to have
      something warm to put on after the ride, and yes they got absolutely drenched,
      pretty funny actually. The first turn involved a big geyser which spouted water
      over everyone in the raft, the raft held 8 people and i was warned by 2 girls
      that i should put my camera away as it will be too wet, well needless to say i
      kept my camera out and ready for action, it got a little wet but nothing which
      caused a problem. The ride was great similar to a real white water rapid ride
      and heaps of fun. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>When we had
      finished it was time for a few more souvenirs and then off to get fast passes
      for the jungle safari, which would now be for around 11am. In the meantime we
      headed over to an area called Dinoland USA; this is very similar to the royal
      Easter show, a bit like side show alley with some roller coaster and games etc.
      There was an area called the Boneyard which was a play area for kids, so Jack
      and Lilia spent some time mucking around and had a great time. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We did a little
      more looking around and walked over the Bridge over the river Kwai, which on
      looked the biggest and scariest ride called Expedition Everest, a huge fast
      paced roller coaster, Jack had previously seen it on you tube so he knew what
      it involved but for me I had no idea what i was about to get myself into. Jack
      is up for any and all rides no matter how scary looking, so naturally I go with
      him. We were within time to get 2 lots of fast passes for Everest, Wendy and
      Lilia's tickets get used by Jack and I for the 2nd go at rides. This was
      scheduled for 1pm and it was hugely popular and the wait at 11am was around 2.5
      hours. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We headed back to
      the Safari and bypassed 50 thousand people in line; we still had to line up but
      only for 5 minutes. We then boarded a 4 wheel jeep type bus and went through
      the safari park where we saw animals such as the White Rhino, Giraffes,
      Elephants and heaps of others, unfortunately the driver pulled up early as he
      was pointing out the animals so it was a bit of pot luck to actually see the
      animals he was referring to, Jack couldn't see much at all which wasn't very
      pleasing, but he still saw the main things. As well i got heaps of photos to
      show him later any animals he may have missed. Wendy and Lilia seemed to be on
      the better side and had a good view of most things.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The trip involved
      going over a rickety old bridge which half collapsed as the vehicle went across
      - all part of the ride but it was a little unnerving as it felt really like the
      bridge was going to collapse.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>This was worth
      the 5 minute line up but i really couldn't imagine waiting for 2 hours to do
      it.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>After this Wendy
      went and raced over to another attraction back at the Dinoland for the rollercoaster
      Jack wanted to do, there was still an hour or so before we could get onto the
      Everest ride so we got the fast passes for later and went through a Jungle walk
      where we got to see such animals as the silver back gorilla, they are just such
      a magnificent animal and i got some good photos of the Gorillas and many other
      animals, all were naturally a long way away from the fences so the viewing was
      from such a distance that you needed a big telephoto lens to get any decent
      photos, i fortunately had mine with me.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>When we had
      finished this we went to Everest finally and the anticipation made it all the
      more exhilarating, an crikey it was a crazy ride - just as well Wendy didn't go
      on it or she would have been very ill. The ride starts fast straight away and you
      enter the bottom of Everest, the cars are now pointing pretty much straight up
      to get up the massive incline, this was a tell-tale sign of what was to come,
      besides you could hear the screaming from other cars already going around, so
      we both knew it was going to be a little hair raising, Jack said &quot;Dad if
      we don't make it I just want you to know I love you&quot;, we held hand tight
      and went over the top and started plummeting towards to ground at breakneck
      speed, only to come up to what looked like a broken track ahead, well Jack knew
      that this was all part of it but I was thinking that we were literally going to
      crash, needless to say it was all part of the ride experience, the cars came to
      a stop just before hitting the broken tracks and then started to go backwards
      back along the same track, but this time we hurtled towards the ground
      backwards and the cars went onto the sides making everyone feel like we were
      going to fall out, back up to the top again and then back down. What a rush, it
      was very scary so much so that we decided once was enough and kept the other 2
      fast passes as souvenirs instead of using them.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>After we survived
      this we went to Dinoland USA to go on yet again another roller coaster, this
      one involved a lot of spinning and sudden turns and drops, it was fun but boy
      did i feel the need for solid ground after. Despite standing on solid ground it
      still felt like the ground was moving for some time afterwards.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We then went and
      got some more fast passes for an interactive dinosaur ride, both Wendy and
      Lilia were coming on this one too which would be fun, the time wouldn't allow
      us to enter for another 30 minutes or so, so we wandered through some shops. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The kids have
      discovered &quot;Pins&quot;, they are basically little collectable pins you pin
      through a neck lanyard, they are available everywhere and there are literally
      hundreds to choose from, including every possible kind you could imagine, 1 for
      each ride in each park, all characters in many different forms, star wars
      characters etc. In fact in the US it has been very popular for quite some years
      so much so that here that they have collectable pin conventions where tens of
      thousands of people travel from all corners to come to the conventions to trade
      pins, it is a huge craze here, none of which us Aussie would know about as they
      have never hit our shores, fortunately as it would cost a small fortune, each
      pi costing around $10.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We also got a few
      more novelty flattened penny’s, this is where you place a penny into a machine
      and it flattened and imprinted with a scene or character from Disneyworld, they
      are everywhere but a good cheap souvenir, so far we have over 20 from LA, NY
      and here, no doubt we'll get more along our travels too.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It was now around
      2:30 and we were nearing the end of our Animal Kingdom day, so far this has
      been the first park where we actually got to do everything we had planned
      within a single day.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We had 1 more
      attraction to see and this was for the ride called dinosaur, this involved
      sitting in a car and traveling through an ancient desolate location searing for
      elusive Dinosaurs, it was very shaky and the whole time i had to hold onto
      Lilia with both hands so as she wasn't thrown all over the place, it was fun
      but pretty uncomfortable when stretched across another seat holding onto her,
      Lilia didn't enjoy it very much, i can understand why too, poor little bugger.
      Since Lilia was unable to go on so may ride due to height restrictions or due
      to fear we allowed her to get a few extra little pins etc. which made up for
      the lack of rides, so she was quite content, she very rarely complains about
      missing out anyway.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well this is the
      end of Animal Kingdom and we made our way back to the front gate, on the way
      was got to see some beautiful birds, such as the big Macaws and some other
      fancy bird for which i forget the name but the colors were incredible, let’s
      hope the photos i took do them justice.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>on the way out I
      stopped by guest relations to purchase some Disney Currency - this is actual
      legal tender notes that Disney Mint print for either souvenirs or to be spent
      within their parks, we decided to keep some for our albums, they are quite
      amazing with such colors and details well worth buying.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We got back to
      camp at around 5pm, I stopped by guest relations to purchase some more currency
      as I had been told you could get different ones at different parks, well they
      were different and worth getting.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We had some time
      in the RV to relax before I took the kids for a swim and Wendy caught up on
      some washing and drying.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It looked like it
      was going to rain so we decided to stay in the night - we were going to try and
      go to Epcot for a fireworks display.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We went to get
      some dinner but there was nowhere to eat as the single resort restaurant was
      booked out and other adjoining resorts restaurants would have taken 30 minutes
      to get to and we couldn't get a reservation for another hour or so, so off the
      little shops to get some wieners and hot dog rolls, we went back and had dinner
      in the RV and watched Tome Sawyer movie, and yes it has started to rain so it
      was a good decision to stay in.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We are just
      hoping that it doesn't rain tomorrow and Friday as we really want to get a
      couple of important things done, some of which include outdoor activities which
      we have missed out on in the last few days due to demand, but we'll just have
      to wait and see.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <h1><a name="_Toc380399342" id="_Toc380399342">Day 11 - Thursday 4th April  Epcot &amp; Hollywood
      Studios</a></h1>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It's still
      raining so we'll just have to see what we can get done today without being
      impacted on by the rain, I’m sure it won't be too big a problem though.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We arrived at
      Epcot at 10:00am only to see yet again incredible lines - not sure what it is
      about Epcot but the lines have been at least 3 times that of the other parks
      both times. We went straight to the ride called Soarin - which is hugely popular
      - we were lucky to get fast pass tickets as at 12:00pm they were sold out, the
      ride wasn't until 11:45am so we had plenty of time to get some other
      attractions done.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>There was another
      attraction called Living of the Land which only had 2 people waiting so we
      decided to give it a go, it was more so an educational boat ride showing the
      history of food production in the US and then the new methods of crop raising,
      it was interesting.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We went to have
      some breaky and after this we went through some really nice garden setting
      which were setup based on the theme of the recent movie &quot;The Great and
      Powerful Oz - this movie we happened to see in New York and it was excellent,
      so we got lots of photos and the kids then had a play in a playground with all
      sorts of fun playground equipment.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We then went down
      to another ride called the Nordstrom which was a Viking Ship ride based on
      Norway, it was OK but very short, it only lasted about 5 minutes, funnily this
      was one ride that we were sure we didn't want to miss as there was a lot of
      hype about it, but it was way overrated, but still worth doing, the wait was
      only 5 minutes as we got there right on opening at 11:00am. After this we went
      through a Mexican village setting and went on a Ride called the 3 Amigo's - or
      something like that anyway - it was really well done with loads of classic
      cartoon characters being displayed throughout the ride and very bright and
      colorful, yet again there was no flash photos allowed but I was able to set my
      camera accordingly to get photos without flash.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We were now set
      for the most hyped up ride at Epcot called Soarin, this is a ride where we were
      sitting in a row of seats which then lifted into the air and flew straight into
      a massive projector screen which covered the entire front wall, it basically
      was a birds eye view flying over famous US landmarks such as the Golden Gate
      Bridge, Yosemite, Arizona etc., I thought it was just amazing as did Jack,
      Wendy and Lilia had to focus carefully of a particular spot so as not to get
      sick, but they survived without too much trouble. There were so many people who
      were now prepared to line up for near 3 hours to get a ride as the fast passes
      had all been allocated for the remainder of the day, there were a lot of people
      who just missed out.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We tried to get
      some more special Disney Dollars - there were supposed to be some printed based
      on the theme of the Pirates of the Caribbean but unfortunately despite trying
      at 4 different places they were not available, later on we found out that they
      had in fact been sold out for a long time and it would not be possible to get
      any as they were very collectable, no big deal though as I already had quite a
      few really nice notes based on the 50th anniversary - which i was told are also
      now quite collectable.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well we had to
      make a bee hive home as we had dinner reservations at 4:45pm at Hollywood
      Studios.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We had a quick
      rest and left the RV at 3:00pm, but everything takes so long it took 1 1/2
      hours to get there, no one seems to go beyond slow pace and despite trying to
      catch connecting busses our bus drive seemed to just dawdle along which caused
      us to miss the awaiting but, so we had no choice but to sit for another 30
      minutes waiting for the next bus, finally it arrived and we got to Hollywood
      studios at 4:30pm, just enough time to race over to the Tower of Terror and get
      a fast pass - this was scheduled for 8:00pm. In the next couple of hours we
      were going to have to fit in 3 attractions which were near impossible.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We arrived at the
      restaurant with reservations right on time, only to be told that we had to
      wait, which again put a spanner in the works as it would now mean we would miss
      out on 1 attraction.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We enjoyed the
      dinner which was a buffet style and the food was excellent, but we races
      through our meal to ensure that we had enough time to get to see a couple of
      important shows. Wendy and Lilia raced over to see a show called Beauty and the
      Beast, this took 20 minutes during which Jack and I walked around the shops.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>When this
      finished we had to now race over to another show we really wanted to see which
      was the Indiana Jones stunt Spectacular - this was just incredible and very
      entertaining. once this finished we went to buy Jack a custom Star wars
      lightsaber which he was able to build and customise exactly the way he wanted,
      it was well worth it and he was just stoked.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We were now ready
      for the Tower of Terror - I must say I wasn't overly excited as i knew what i
      was in for, Jack was a little hesitant also but we both went through with it,
      jack loved it I thought it was a bit too stomach dropping for my liking but I’m
      glad i did it, the best thing was the layout and display within the tower, it
      was just incredible, if only i took my camera.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We finished that
      and Wendy was waiting to urge us to hurry as the last thing to do was to see a
      night-time show with fireworks and water displays where the water was sprayed
      into a fan and the various Disney movies were projected into the water streams,
      along with all the characters and spectacular light shows, it was really worth seeing,
      we also have special seating due to having eaten at one of their restaurants,
      which was lucky as the stadium was full to capacity with only standing room
      left.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We had to head
      straight home as we need to return to Hollywood studios in the morning before
      7:00am to try our best to get a spot in the Star Wars Padowan Training - this
      has been booked out for days and Jack wants to do it so badly we just have to
      try again. So we have plans to get there and when the gates open at 7:00 we
      will really have to run to the location to try and reserve a spot for him,
      despite the training show running over a 12 hours period it is just so popular
      and very hard to secure a place.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We will drive the
      RV tomorrow and try to get to the Kennedy Space Centre also tomorrow, so we
      need to make time for parking and we are allocating an extra hour due to all
      the little delays we have been encountering along the way.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Being our last
      day at Disney world tomorrow there were still so many things we just couldn't
      do due to crowds and unavailability, but we are more than happy with what we
      have accomplished.</span></p>

      studios and hopefully Kennedy Space Centre</span></a>.</h1>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Up at 4:30am
      again, need to unplug the RV and leave by 6:00am - I’m getting pretty used to
      about 5 hours sleep now and seem to manage quite well, the kids are still
      getting good night’s sleep although today might be a bit of a struggle, let’s
      hope Jack has enough energy to strike his lightsaber at Darth Vader.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Arrived at
      Hollywood Studios at 7:00am, needed to wait until 7:45am to get through the
      gates but we were first in line - reason being that the demand for Jedi
      Training is so popular - whilst we were waiting we got talking to the staff and
      they let us scan in before the gates opened so we could get a head start on the
      1000 people who had since arrived, they were here for either Jedi Training or
      Toy Story Mania ( another attraction we have been unable to do due to demand ).</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>When they said
      open the race was on, Wendy and Jack ran (despite the staff saying to everyone
      not to run) and were first to register for Jedi Training, scheduled for 9:20,
      now the only pending problem was the weather as they have no hesitation in
      cancelling if the rain comes, but we told Jack to be positive and it would be
      all ok.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Surprisingly we
      had time to go to Toy Story Mania and didn't even need fast passes as it had
      just opened and the wait was a mere 1o minutes, this attraction was just
      awesome. It was basically a slow moving ride which went through a neon lit toy
      story landscape and within each car both riders had virtual guns to shoot at
      targets on huge screens in front of our cars, it was just so much fun and we
      were all so glad we got to do it, it was on our planes from the beginning but
      we had truly underestimated the crowds.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Mind you the
      crowds were significantly worse due to spring break which goes for up to 6
      weeks, so there was no getting away from the crowds no matter what time we
      tried to get there.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We then got some
      more character photos of Minnie Mouse with Lilia, bought some more- yes more
      Disney Pins ( these are so popular here that there is a book for collectors
      which contain over 15000 pins) after which the time had arrived for Jedi
      Training- Jack has been wanting this so badly and we were so happy for him.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We lines up for
      initiation and watched him line up with his Jedi gown ( the same brown ones
      that Obi Wan Kenobi wore in Star Wars ) and then finally the boys and girls
      were called up on stage to face Darth Vader with 2 Storm Troopers. He was
      excited despite his shyness. Anyway things just didn't work out for the poor
      bugger as just after 2 little boys had done their face off with Darth Vader it
      started to rain, ever so slightly, but quicker than you could say &quot;It's
      Raining&quot; Darth Vader just walked off and left all the kids just standing
      there, then shortly after an announcement came over that the show had been
      cancelled, he was 2 boys away from getting to fight Darth Vader.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>I just felt so
      angry that we had tried so hard to get this for him and yet despite all our
      efforts he couldn't get the one thing he was so desperate to do.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>I could see in
      his face he just wanted to burst out crying but he held it together and was so
      brave.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We questions why
      they had cancelled when it was hardly what you would call rain, but they just
      said they will organise for a photo shoot opportunity with Darth Vader and the
      Storm Troopers inside the Star Wars Tours ride, well that was something, and
      fortunately Jack had his custom built lightsaber which he was able to hold up
      for photos - I was fully prepared with my big flash gun so the photo was
      excellent and he will be proud of it. He also got a certificate but hasn't
      actually looked at it.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well after such a
      huge disappointment we yet again asked if there was anything they could do
      considering the effort we had put in to make it, but they basically didn't give
      a toss and said that's the luck of the draw and you could walk back to line up
      and try to schedule a later timeslot, no surprise all time slots had since been
      booked out.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>To make todays
      experience even worse we went back to a particular shop to buy a special Disney
      pin for Lilia but just like last time this kiosk was closed and wouldn't open
      until midday, we had tried twice to buy it as this was the only place that sold
      this particular pin, and it was considered very collectable. We were told to
      find the area manager and told to go to this certain place, we did and it was
      the wrong place so we asked another person who also sent us to the wrong place,
      we then asked another only to get sent the wrong way again, we finally asked a
      man cleaning the paths and he actually sent us to the right spot. We got there
      and waited 15 minutes to see the manager who was a very nice lady and walked us
      over to the kiosk and opened it up for us to make our purchase, well at least
      this worked out ok in the end.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It was now
      nearing 12:00pm and we had done 1 ride and bought 1 pin since 7:00am, pretty
      typical of how long things take.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Anyway we needed
      to hurry back to the RV and drive an hour to the Kennedy Space Centre - I was
      really excited to come back here not that i remembered anything other than my
      medallion and space shuttle model i got when we came here as a family when i
      was just 10 in 1981, just around the time Space Shuttle Columbia was launched
      for the first time - you may recall that in 2003 the Columbia exploded upon
      re-entry and all crew were lost.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We arrived at the
      KSC at about 2:00pm - the drive took longer than expected.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The crowds were
      nothing like Disney world though so that in itself was a nice change. It is
      very well laid out with a rocket garden displaying past launched rockets and
      satellites, some of which you could get into for photos.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We walked around
      and I naturally took far too many pictures. We then went and saw an IMAX 3D
      movie called Hubble 3D, it was just amazing so much so that I want both Lilia
      and Jack to become astronaut - there not interested as it's far too scary
      knowing how intricate the work they do, they are absolutely just amazing
      people.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We wandered
      around the gift shop and bought some souvenirs and I bought a book called the
      30 Years of Space Shuttle History, starting from Columbia right up to the
      current Space Shuttle Atlantis, I haven't opened it yet as it sealed and look
      too good to open.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We finished off a
      successful afternoon and headed back to the Camp Wilderness just for the night,
      we would need an early night as we had to leave early in the morning to stay on
      schedule for our big day at Universal Studios tomorrow.</span></p>

    <h1><a name="_Toc380399344" id="_Toc380399344">Day 13 - Saturday 6th April  Universal Studios
      Island of Adventure</a></h1>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Universal Studios
      in Orlando has 2 theme parks - Universal Studios as well as Island of
      Adventure, we only had the time and money to go to the 1 park but it was the
      better of the two, a single days entry cost over $500, and to be honest I was
      pretty much over theme parks and crowds and was so looking forward to our road
      trip so 1 park was more than enough.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We arrived 1
      minute before opening at 8:59am, it was a fluke we got there in time as we had
      intended to get there at 8:00am but our GPS kept sending us in a loop and just
      didn't know where to go so we wasted an hour trying to find parking. We were
      the only RV in the parking lot and we though perhaps it was going to be fairly
      quiet, well I must have been delusional because the crowds were nearly as large
      as DW. Anyway we had Express Passes which like Disney world needed to bought in
      advance to get then otherwise you just have to line up for hours for all
      attractions, so that was lucky that Wendy had done such an amazing job in
      planning this holiday to absolute perfection, she researched everything and was
      fully prepared. We got through the gates after the standard bag search (this
      happens everywhere now - all due to 911) and then scanned our barcoded tickets
      and scanned our fingerprint which is then associated to our tickets, again the
      scanning of fingers happens at all major theme parks to stop someone else using
      your ticket in case it gets lost - so you can be assured that you can always
      get another ticket just in case.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>In we went and
      straight away we headed over to Harry Potter World which is the most popular
      attraction, they say if you don't get in the line by 10:00am you will miss out,
      and there was no express line for this ride so we lines up with another 1000
      people for 75 minutes. But i tell you what the setup and design was absolutely
      mind blowing, walking through this massive old castle and the inside was just
      incredible, mind you this was all just the lead up for a ride of your lifetime.
      Wendy and Lilia chose not to go on the ride due to the potential for motion
      sickness, but Jack and I were eager to get going and it was most definitely the
      best ride so far, the ride took us on a virtual rollercoaster where we were
      flying a broomstick following closely behind Harry Potter, we went through the
      castle, had fights with dragons, just escaped falling towers and so much more i
      just cannot begin to explain it like it happened, I was only able to take my
      camera so far and had to give it to Wendy just before we started the ride.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It was really so
      amazing. After this we had some brunch, hamburgers and chips - pretty much the
      most commonly available food anywhere, i had another cup of the most awful
      coffee too which was really nice - NOT - god knows how they can drink the
      stuff, very few places sell good coffee of Cappuccino’s.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>When we finished
      eating we went to a ride called Jurassic Park, which was another ride where
      were going to get Possible definitely soaks as the attendant pointed out, there
      was no chance of staying dry, Lilia didn't want to go but we convinced her it
      would be OK, she didn't want to get wet, even though she can spend 3 weeks in a
      pool in the middle of winter - go figure?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We went to try
      and go on more rides we had earmarked but there were limitations such as height
      restrictions and ridiculous waiting times so we just had to pass, but finally
      after walking around and enjoying the shops and watching others ride the
      attractions we couldn't do we saw the mother of all rollercoasters, I just had
      to go on this. It was called the Hulk and it was just incredible - just wait
      until you see the photos; it's enough to scare the crap out of you just by
      looking. Well Jack wasn't keen on this at all and I was prepared to go it
      alone, but after some gentle persuasion i convinced him he would be ok, luckily
      his hair was sticking up and he was able to pass the height limit. I did feel
      terrible as I could see the fear in the poor buggers face but kept reassuring
      him that it would be so fat that when it go around the 4 upside down loops that
      he wouldn't fall out due to the G-force pulling you in to the seat - i was
      right. I was supposed to take my glasses off but forgot, i was also holding on
      to Jack with one hand as i was so worried about him. The ride was the fastest
      and most exhilarating ride i have ever experienced and was just amazing, Jack
      did enjoy it as he was screaming (good screams) the whole time, despite saying
      he wanted to cry when he had finished but he was actually all good and I think
      it was just the unknown and all the anticipation and anxiety he built up when
      lining up. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It was now about
      12:00pm and we had actually done enough which meant we could exit the park
      after a few more souvenirs and get started on our road trip - whohoo!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We had a 5 hour
      drive ahead of us and had planned to get to Florida State Caverns National Park
      at 5pm, there was a time difference of an hour were hadn't accounted for and as
      such arrived at 9:00pm. We knew we were going to be late as within 30minutes of
      getting onto the Interstate Highway 10 West there was the most incredible
      traffic jam which took us well over an hour to pass, it turns out there was an
      accident on both side of the highway, although we did only see the accident on
      the other side of the rode and sadly it was an RV very similar to what we had,
      it had run of the rode and was on its side completely squashed, it looks awful
      and we took this as notice to take it easy and drive as safely as possible. Regardless
      of how safely i drove the Americans are shocking drivers, they speed well over
      20 miles per hour above the speed limit, they seem to had absolutely no
      courtesy on the roads, so much so that 1 driver just decided to slam on his
      breaks after deciding to turn, no indicator nothing, this was when we got to
      test the brakes, and i was able to pull up just in time despite things going
      everywhere in the cabin, yet again another reminder to take it easy even if it
      means getting to our destination late.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The speed limits
      on the I10 are 70 miles per hour which is the same as 100K, so were certainly
      moving  and trying to keep such a large RV in the middle of a road that extends
      about 10 inches either side of our mirrors was hard enough, there is the
      constant need to correct form wind etc. and each time fatigue plays a major
      part as the rods are just so long and straight, massive concentration is needed
      and you need to be so alert as people will cut in front of you causing you to
      have to break constantly.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We had a few
      stops along the way as we needed to just to stay alert and we were not going to
      drive recklessly no matter how late we arrived. We finally had to pull over for
      some dinner and chose one of the hundreds of take away places to choose from,
      this time we stopped at Wendy’s for, guess what, Hamburgers you guessed it, but
      they were so nice we have to stop there again, unless i get to stop at a dunkin
      doughnuts that is, or Denny's or Top 50 ok you get the idea we could eat take
      out for ever here, perhaps that why there is such an obesity problem here? The
      most amazing thing was to see the most gorgeous black cats - they were stray
      but looked to be very well looked after, it turned out there were 9 black cats
      in this little family and then two Tabby's joined in, so we shared a little
      chicken and meat patties with them and the 11 of them guts it up no worries, we
      got some photos but they were a little too timid to be approached, but it was
      quite an amazing site to see 9 black cats sitting around our RV with us having
      dinner, the kids were thrilled.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>it was now about
      6:00pm and we had another few hours to go until we arrived at our campsite, we
      finally got there at around 9pm, by which time the front gate had closed hours
      ago but Wendy in all her wisdom had pre-arranged for a PIN number to allow us
      to gain entry to the park, we then drove through the most beautiful forest for
      about 5 minutes to get to the hook-up location. After a few minutes the kids
      were already asleep - even though they had a few hours’ sleep in the RV whilst
      driving they were obviously just work out as it had been pretty full on up till
      now.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>I couldn't get to
      sleep and went outside at 2:00am, but something made me feel really nervous
      like there was a big grizzly bear about to eat me so i headed straight back
      inside - it was getting pretty cool now too. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It was to be an
      early start tomorrow as we were going to go on a Cave Tour which we were told
      you need to book by 7:30 to get spots, this meant another early morning.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <h1><a name="_Toc380399345" id="_Toc380399345">Day 14 - Sunday 7th April  Florida’s State Cavers
      Cave Tour and then head to New Orleans</a></h1>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We arrived at the
      Cave Tour entry point at about 8:30am, we had since discovered it was an 8:30am
      start and not 7:30am, but to our surprise after seeing no one at the building
      and seeing that the doors were all unlocked, we went in to have a look at the
      little museum that they had setup whilst we waited for someone to arrive so as
      we could secure some tickets, well surprise surprise someone finally arrived
      and said we were in the right spot for the tour but you needed to get your
      tickets way down at the front entry gates, so off we headed trying to hurry and
      get our tickets early enough, when we got there, there was a very nice ranger
      who had told us of the time difference and we had gained an hour sometime
      yesterday, even though we were still in the state of Orlando, so it was
      actually just after 7:30am and they were not going to open for another hour.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We sat in the RV
      and had some breakfast and waited. The man then yelled out to us that he was
      just going to raise the flags and he would then take care of us, which was
      nice, plus an opportunity to get some photos, they raise a US flag, and flag
      for the fallen heroes from the Vietnam War as well as the Florida Flag, and I
      got some nice photos.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>As well whilst
      waiting the scenery was just beautiful and I could have snapped pictures all
      day.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We headed back up
      to the Caves and went on a trail walk, which took us through swamps and
      marshes, again the photo opportunities were amazing if only I had purchased
      this nice wide angle lens i saw in NY - it was over $1000 and although Wendy
      was happy for me to buy it i just couldn't bring myself to spend that much -
      but if I had boy would I have had some incredible photo's.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The little gift
      shop opened up just before the Cave tours started which allowed us to buy some
      souvenirs, a few little gifts for jack and Lilia's school mates as well.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The Cave tour
      started about 9:30am, and we wandered down, only for Jack to tell the tour
      guide that &quot;My Dad took us down to the caves earlier whilst we were
      waiting&quot; - well what i did was a no no - so I was trying to hush him up
      before they actually listened, luckily I was able to add to what he said and
      mentioned that we had actually only gone down some of the track not into the
      caves, phew.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The caves are
      actually tiny when compared to something like Jenolan or Wombean Caves, both of
      which we as a family had enjoyed back home so we had higher expectations, but
      nonetheless the tour was enjoyable and interesting, lots of history in the area
      dating back some 400 years to a very early Indian settlement.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>As we wandered
      through the tour I kept getting stuck behind the tour as I was just so
      engrossed in taking photos (all very low light and no flash - no tripod so each
      one took a little longer than those using their dodgy IPhone’s as cameras,
      anyway they patiently waited for me to catch up only for me to get left behind
      pretty much straight away, Jack stayed with me though as they know I can get
      lost very easily.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We finished the
      tour after about 45 minutes and were about to see the first wildlife for the
      day, it was a tiny little bat about 2 inches long happily tucked away inside a
      small cave pocket, I saw everyone looking but you couldn't see the bat until
      you were right up close.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>All in all it was
      a nice tour and a good start to the day.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It was time to
      head on the road again as today we would pass through 4 states, Orlando,
      Alabama, Mississippi and finally our destination of Louisiana - being New
      Orleans.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We had another 5
      hours’ drive ahead of us and to start things of we got lost trying to find
      petrol and a Wal-Mart to stock up on some food.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>An hour later we
      were back onto the I10 heading west. A very similar trip to yesterday where
      fatigue play a big part and you need to be so aware of whats going on. To make
      things a little worse today I was taking precautions and went to check the air,
      but all tyres were able to be checked except for the drivers front side where
      the nozzle just wouldn't fit, after trying 3 times i gave up in frustration as
      all that was happening was the air was coming out, I had to stop or we would
      have had a flat and according to locals there was no adapter, so we would have
      been in all sorts of strife.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We made it to
      Alabama border and then next to Mississippi and it was now nearing 4pm, we also
      didn't know if it we were gaining more time as we went, but finally made it in
      about 6 hours to New Orleans, the time was about 7:30pm but there was still
      sufficient time to get some touring done and to get to the Cafe Du Monde - I
      had been waiting so long for this. The Cafe is 150 years old now and was the
      original stop for Coffee and French Doughnuts - called Beignets, so naturally
      the first place we had to go was here.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We were told not
      to say out after dark as it's just too dangerous, so that wasn't overly
      reassuring to know, but we went out for a couple of hours and made sure we
      would catch a taxi back to the RV Park.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We stopped by
      Cafe Du Monde and had Beignets and Coffee, Hot Chocolate for Wendy and Lilia
      whilst Jack just had coke, but the doughnuts were just as I remembered. I took
      lots of photos of the cafe and we bought Beignet mixes, and more souvenirs.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We continued
      walking the streets on New Orleans, mainly Bourbon Street and adjoining
      streets, the photo opportunities are amazing although i couldn't help feel
      nervous like i was going to get my camera stolen, as there are just so many
      homeless people.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We finished up at
      about 9:00pm and got a taxi back to the RV Park which is surrounded by huge
      walls with razor sharp spikes all over, massive security gates which are only
      accessible with a pin number. We made it back and the kids and Wendy pretty
      much it the hay straight away.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>This was my
      chance however to update the travel blog as I was worried I would start to
      forget certain things, and every little detail is worth remembering, perhaps
      I'm putting in too much detail but at least we will have a good record of our
      memories.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It’s now 10:30pm
      and I am back up to date which is a huge relief.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>There are so many
      sirens going off around us, we know the city turns rough and dangerous with
      lots of crime after dark, hence the reason they say to stay inside and not to
      go wandering around, plus there are certain things which go on here in New
      Orleans that we don't want the kids seeing, such as all the prostitution etc.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well tomorrow I
      have 6 hours of driving to do, so I need to hit the hay to get a good night's
      sleep. We have to check out at 11:00am and if we have finished touring New
      Orleans by then we will head off otherwise we'll go and find a secure parking
      area for the RV. We'll be heading through to Texas tomorrow which is the
      biggest state in the US so it should be quite a drive. </span></p>

    <h1><a name="_Toc380399346" id="_Toc380399346">Day 15 - Monday 8th April  New Orleans through to
      Gladewater Texas</a></h1>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We were all up
      nice and early about and whilst Wendy went and did some washing and drying at
      the parks facilities the kids went for a swim, there was a nice hot spa bath
      that they enjoyed which was no doubter much nicer than the freezing cold pool
      which they went from one to the other like typical crazy kids who seem to be
      immune to the cold water.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We had this
      morning to do some more wandering of the streets of New Orleans and bought some
      souvenirs and I bought another book - that makes 5 now, this time it's a book
      about the aftermath of Katrina. You will remember Katrina hit in 2005 and it
      took about 5 years for New Orleans to recover. The French Quarters was left
      pretty much untouched but the surrounding areas were flattened and there were
      over 100 lives lost. The book is called &quot;1 Dead in the Attic&quot; which
      was used as a reference to signage that were placed in in front of houses to
      indicate the status of human toll within each house. There was an old retired
      wharfie who was stuck in his 3rd floor attic, left with just a can of juice and
      a bedspread and unfortunately the floods got him, hence there was a sign on the
      front of his house saying 1 dead in the attic, it such a compelling read which
      you all should read when i get home.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>There are lots of
      old cemeteries - one near where we stayed called St Louis Cemetery which is
      over 300 years old, it is in pretty much total ruin apart from recent attempts
      to restore certain parts, many of the haunted New Orleans tours take place here
      - I went for a quick walk and took some pictures and overheads a tour guide
      talking about a lady who struggled to win a legal battle only to pass away
      before her settlement of 36 million dollars - this money went to the state.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The houses are
      just amazing and the use of wrought iron is most noticeable, everywhere from
      gutter plates, bins, and downpipes and of course balconies. Most of the houses
      or rather building in and around the French Quarters are 3 stories high and
      have so much charm; you could quite literally take photos all day.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The shops are
      also very nice, especially the book shop we went to, it was only 45 years old
      but looked much older, and I could have spent hours inside just looking. I also
      went into a Record store, Jack and I wandered around 2 levels of vinyl and did
      find some Yello records - all of which I already had but it had been a long
      time since i had an opportunity to wander through and flick through vinyl
      records. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We wanted to get
      back by 10:30am to checkout - we could then either do some more walking around
      of get an early start on our pending 6 hour drive to Texas. So we returned via
      Cable Car which was a nice treat and something a little different for the kids
      - even though the kids and Wendy had been to Melbourne as a port stop on one of
      their many cruises and been on a Melbourne Cable Car the kids didn't remember
      so it was like a new experience.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It felt far safer
      walking the streets in day time too, all though there were remnants of the
      prior nights, many of whom had found somewhere to sleep like in the middle of
      the side walk or someone’s driveway, and yes there was a bit of a stench to the
      area which from my understanding is just part of the parcel.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We were back
      before the 11:00am checkout time and were on track for our next part of the
      road trip. We hit the road and were onto the I10 west at 11:00 and passed over
      the massive bridge crossing the Mississippi River - the same bridge we were
      looking at when wandering the river last night wondering what it was, we were
      not even aware at the time last night that beside the French quarters where the
      paddle steamers were was in fact the Mississippi River so we got confirmation
      of that, and it sure is a big river although travelling on the way here we
      crossed much bigger river systems. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The state of
      Louisiana is massive and we were not expecting to cross the border until near
      the end of the day.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The roads were
      pretty poor and made of concrete, at each section there was a change in the
      level of road which meant the RV was just bouncing all over the place, the
      speed limit had also now increased to 75 mph, which was just too fast in my
      mind so i reduced the speed to make the drive a little safer.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>There are bridges
      that go for about 10 miles, they just seem to go on forever over swampy areas,
      and it just seems incredible how much swamp land there is.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The other thing
      we noticed were all the roller coaster type over passes which just seem to rise
      above way too high and have an element of danger to each one, the lanes are
      narrow and one accidental misjudgement would call for a massive drop over the
      bridge to certain death, these appear out of nowhere and sometime you wonder
      why they did it and there was solid ground that could have easily supported the
      road, but not here they rise like 5 stories high and seem to just balance on
      these little skinny poles just dangling in the sky.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>For 5 hours there
      were no rest stops - this was the single most disappointing thing as the
      fatigue plays a huge part in having a safe drive and with nowhere to pull over
      to freshen up and stretch your legs it became quite tedious. We filled up with
      fuel before leaving but within a couple of hours needed more fuel to ensure we
      had enough to get us to our destination, luckily we filled up at the next
      available exit next door to a Popeye's food outlet, it was lucky as this was
      the last petrol stop I saw for the entire remainder of the trip. Although the
      roads improved they were just so long and straight and the country side is very
      nice it doesn't change all that much.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Within the whole
      state of Louisiana there was just a single road side rest stop which had been
      closed, we kind of got the idea and as such needed to take a break and pulled
      of down a random exit hoping to find somewhere else to park, we end up driving
      for miles through some nice country side on this very small country road -
      probably not designed for RV's, but it didn't stop other drivers from
      overtaking or pulling out in front. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We had one lady
      pull onto the road from a T intersection only to just stop dead in the middle
      of the road, her truck was stopped across the road so she took up both lanes,
      she just stopped, god only knows why, but she beckoned us to go around her -
      there was hardly any room to do so but we got passed only to see that she then
      turned around and started to follow us, why she didn't just make a normal left
      hand turn and drive like a normal person is beyond me. Another time we crossed
      a very narrow bridge with a warning sign as to how narrow it was, despite
      having arrived to cross the bridge well before another huge ute, the ute
      thought there would be enough room for both of us and just screamed straight at
      us with no consideration to slow down or perhaps to wait for us to pass, as
      such I was within centimetres of hitting to side rails, this was a reminder of
      the Disney world’s rides we had been on but just a little too real to want to
      experience again, this seems to be the normal for these people, when they are
      in their cars they are like Jeckle and Hyde and Wendy had righty pointed out,
      very considerate outside but in the car it seems there is no one else for them
      to even see. Anyway we arrived at the first available road to turn around as we
      were obviously not going to find somewhere to pull over to rest, low and behold
      it was a dump station - not the nicest of places to want to have a rest, but
      nonetheless my back was killing me and my fingers were starting to clamp up
      from holding onto the steering wheel that i just had to stop, so we asked the
      man at the dump station if we could stop outside, he was very nice and assured
      us we could stay as long as we wanted - well that was only going to be minutes,
      there wasn't any likelihood we were planning on spending the night although I
      think he perhaps though that may have been our intention. Well after a very
      quick stretch we went back via the same route we came in on and got back onto
      the highway - it would be another hour before another exit where we could stop
      and get some food and have a proper rest.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We succumbed to
      McDonalds as Lilia was begging us for days to have some, I wasn't really keen
      for Maccas as there are just so many options but what the heck.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>By this time it
      was about 6:pm and we were within an hour or so from making it to the Texan
      border which seemed to take forever to reach, so we got back on the highway and
      went for the last leg of today’s drive and made it to our RV place at about
      7:30pm.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Once we found our
      spot called Shallow Creek RV Resort we discovered that the reception area had
      closed at 6:00pm, there were many available spot but you can’t just take any
      old spot as it was likely people had reserved spots just like what we had
      expected to be the case for us, how wrong we were.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Wendy went down
      to see what information they had left - there were 3 pieces of paper stating
      that there were only 3 available spots for late arrivals, Wendy chose the top
      one as it shouldn't have made a difference, there was room to fill out your
      name and let them know which site you had taken so as to eliminate confusion
      for other guests who may also be arriving late. The first spot we were allowed
      to choose was taken by someone who obviously didn't comprehend that the space
      was not there for them unless they had just failed to fill the form and decided
      to take the spot, so we went back and got the next number allocated, yet again
      it had been taken. We had one last chance to get the last space which should
      have been reserved for us, only to see that someone had decided to park their
      car there, so we drove around wondering what to do only to realise I would need
      to ask them to move their car. These people were ok and acknowledged that they
      had been watching us drive around for 30 minutes trying to get a spot and
      though perhaps they needed to move their car dumb arses didn't even have right
      to be there as they already had their car parked in their allocated car spot beside
      their massive trailer, but they had a visitor park in our spot. Anyway they
      moved it without too much concern and we finally were able to plug in and get
      set for a night’s sleep. Sometimes the lack of consideration is just
      incredible, how much space do they think they have the right too?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Anyway that all
      done now and we are over it and just want to get some rest. We are in a place
      called Gladewater but there isn't much to see other than heaps of bug RV's and
      busses so it's pretty much stay inside tonight. The weather in nice and
      comfortable so it should be a nice easy night.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The kids hit the
      hay straight away whilst Wendy does some banking and stuff and I start reading
      my Katrina book, I stayed up far too late reading though and didn't get to bed
      until around 11:00pm, although if I had gone to bed earlier i would be up
      earlier.  As it stands I usually get up around 5:00 to check the blog if
      possible or to take photos so I really don't mind.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well it's now
      Tuesday morning on the 9th April - we have just over a week to go. it's still
      pretty dark at 5:00am so I'm update the travel log and will probably have a few
      coffees before the others wake up. I was going to take some photos of the sky
      and last night it was the a very clear night and there were so many stars, but
      this morning there is a little cloud so no photos, just a quick update and a
      little reading. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We should have
      some time this morning for the kids to have another swim before we head off to
      Fort Worth and finally to Childress where we have opted for a night in a
      Holiday Inn....</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;

    <h1><a name="_Toc380399347" id="_Toc380399347">Day 16 - Tuesday 9th April  Fort Worth Texas</a></h1>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We left
      Gladewater about 10:00am and went to get some fuel - the service station floor
      was littered with these big bugs like rhino beetles, there would have been
      thousands - mostly squashed by vehicles driving in and out but the floor
      outside had a certain color to it, when you looked a little closer you could
      see many of them moving, it was quite eerie. We got fuel and some snack for the
      big drive ahead.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The roads were
      not so much straight this time which eliminated much of the boredom we had when
      driving through Louisiana. After a few hours we were about to pass through
      Dallas which you could see well before in the distance, behind Dallas though
      there were the darkest clouds which looked ominous. I would have liked to go
      into Dallas but it wasn't part of the trip but it just so happens that due to
      massive road works we got lost (surprise surprise) and where did we end up,
      Dallas city. We stopped to get our bearings and whilst our navigator checked
      the maps via the GPS Jack and I went for the quickest sightseeing yet, 5
      minutes around the closest 2 blocks to see if i could get a sew on patch - we
      found stores with 40 million cowboy hats and boots but no patches, they just
      don't seem to do them anymore. So that tour of Dallas was over. But it is quite
      a beautiful city much the size of Sydney city with perhaps less tall
      skyscrapers though. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Wendy had sussed
      out the correct way to bypass Dallas and head for Fort Worth witch was really bordering
      on the outskirts of the city anyway so it was just another 40 minutes or so.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>When we arrived
      you could see the difference straight away - no city here - just ranches and
      land, but really this was the Texas we had been imagining all along so it was
      really good. The main street of Forth Worth is where they do a cattle run down
      the main street twice a day for the benefit of tourists, there were so few
      tourists though so crowds were not a problem. We got parking nice and easily
      and got out to see the sites, now this area covered perhaps 3 blocks by 3
      blocks so it certainly wasn't huge, there were a nice selections of shops, bars
      ( saloons i mean ) and other little shops nothing for the locals though this
      was there little slice of tourism.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The first thing
      we did was to let Jack have a go on a mechanical bull, yep it sounded scary as
      i had seen them before and know they are usually extremely hard, but the
      operator sussed out Jacks age and skill level and made it appropriate for him,
      he stayed on the hole time and was thrilled, for just 5 bucks it was money well
      spent. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We then walked up
      and down the main street buying souvenirs and got a little food, and had some
      photos with Wild Bill Hickok and another cowboy and his prized bull before the
      cattle run which was scheduled for 4:00pm. The cattle run started and there was
      a herd of about 20 big bulls herded down the main drag with the full cowboy
      setup, horses etc., it was something none of us had ever experienced and this
      was a prize part of the day. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>After this we had
      time for a couple more shops to yet again try to get a patch - so hard to find.
      We didn't get one but as usual the locals love to ask us where we are from and
      where we are going, then they proceed to talk for 35 minutes, this time though
      the lady advised us of some oncoming weather which would be worth avoiding, so
      we took notice. This was now the time to start the drive to Childress which was
      about 3 hours away.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We drove through
      absolutely terrifying weather tonight for over 3 hours, the most difficult
      driving i have ever done, the RV was getting pulled and pushed by massive winds
      and the steering wheel was mostly at 45 degree angle just to compensate, it was
      quite scary but we are all OK and arrived safely if not a little shaken from
      the experience. My hands were so tensed trying to hold the steering wheel but
      there wasn't much we could do, getting stuck in the oncoming storm was not an
      option. Anyway we arrived at Childress Texas at 9:30pm it is now nearly
      midnight, we got here just as the rain started hammering, fortunately i guess
      we only had to put up with 60 mph winds - we listened to a radio broadcast
      suggesting everyone take cover - not the news you want when driving in a
      strange place on the open interstate highways with big semi-trailers overtaking
      you and knowing that the RV was swerving all over, i tried my best to keep
      straight and i think i did really well considering,</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>I'd like to go
      and get my asthma spray but the weather doesn't permit so I am just sitting
      quietly for a little while until it passes, the snow, wind and hail that is. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The rain is
      pretty much horizontal. There is snow all over the ground, something we really
      didn't expect to see. We pulled in to a truck stop on the way as we needed
      petrol, we asked some truckies if it was safe to continue as we were having
      great difficulty in maintaining a straight line whilst driving as the RV is
      quite light and has the top which just gets pushed around like a toy, they said
      it will hail but not at Childress, so we decided to continue as we had booked
      accommodation in a hotel last night, thank god for that decision as sleeping in
      the RV tonight through a severe thunderstorm would have been frightening.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>What an
      experience. The kids so badly wanted to see snow and here it is but they are
      fast asleep, I ducked out a short while ago to get some photos so as they could
      see it in case it melts by morning, i asked the lady at the front counter and
      she said that it was expected to snow and it certainly was doing that.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Anyway I'll
      update the rest of today as soon as possible but it's been a huge long day and
      i need to relieve the stress in my body as it is so tense from the worry of
      getting my family to safety.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Not that you
      would hear about this on the news but it was a pretty big night and wanted to
      give you a quick update. Night Night</span></p>

      it had gone from 83 down to 16 and it sure felt like it. Needless to say that
      the kids were just in awe of the snow as this was the first time they saw it,
      let alone playing in it. We were a little concerned though as the road in,
      which was within view was covered with flashing police lights, i though the roads
      must have been blocked but it turned out a semi had gone on its side in the ice
      and it was just police to alert oncoming traffic - yes the traffic kept going.
      There were a lot of semi's and RV's who had pulled onto the side roads to avoid
      the treacherous road conditions so we could tell it wasn't really safe yet to
      drive off, well it was only 6:00am anyway so we went to have breaky in the
      restaurant - well it was actually a casual room with large TV. There were quite
      a few council truckies who gave us some advice regarding the weather etc., most
      had suggested this weather was extremely unusual and quite unexpected.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It was expected
      to clear by 10:00am, well it didn't, the snow covering the RV didn't budge
      until 2:00pm when we were well within desert regions and the sun was belting
      down. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We end up going
      across to Wal-Mart to get some supplies and the walk over was just horrible,
      only 2 minutes walk but the wind just cut straight through and it was freezing.
      Time for beanie’s and double jackets now.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We left at about
      11:00 and had another 6 hours to get to Albuquerque in New Mexico.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The drive was
      slow which felt like we would never make it, it wasn't until about half way
      when i finally were able to pull to the die of the road as there was not a
      single truck stop along the way but we had this terrible noise coming from
      under the truck which need to be looked at - turns out it was a mudflap which
      started hitting the undercarriage when we got to 65 mph, the speed limit was 75
      mph so we couldn't maximise our time for this whole part of the trip. A short
      time later we filled up with gas and got straight back onto the road as we were
      soon approaching Amarillo Texas which was well regarded as a big tourist
      destination, we pulled into to a tourist centre and spoke to a man who gave us
      some good advice on what to see and do in the local area. There were some
      freebies for the kids also. Lilia noticed the signs warning of rattlesnakes so
      she was now looking all around in fear of rattlesnakes, i reassured her it was
      meant as a warning when stoping on the side of the road and going for a wander
      but i really didn't know the extent of the warning myself.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The first stop
      was a mistake and most likely we followed the map wrong but we felt we had been
      given a bum steer either way we wasted an hour getting lost in Amarillo city
      for no reason whatsoever, only to head back out and on to an area which was the
      towns slice of Route 66, we found somewhere to eat and had some burgers and
      nachos, all of which was lovely except for a few hairs we found which suddenly
      killed our appetite. We wandered through a game store and bought a few little
      Pokémon things for Jack and a game for their Nintendo DS - a US copy as i had a
      feeling they would work in our Aussie units despite all the warning against
      doing so - I was correct so we landed a game for just $6 and this sets us up to
      get a few more cheapies along the way rather than pay the crazy prices in AU
      like $59. We then went into an antique shop and it was the most incredible
      store - if only we lived here we would have bought so much more as they are so
      cheap - i was seeing all these things we could buy for next to nothing and
      resell them on eBay for a motza but we just couldn't. We did find some original
      star wars toys and an antique set of spectacle that we bought plus a few other
      bits and pieces.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Now it was time
      to get back on the road and try to make Albuquerque before nightfall. One the
      way well after 3 hours i needed to stop as i was getting very weary, we noticed
      it was starting to snow, we pulled into the first available truck stop
      surrounded by the nicest rocky mountains and boulders you had ever seen and yes
      the snow was falling, the kids were so excited and it was really nice, the wind
      had settled a little which made the drive good and fast at 75mph, but to see
      the snow fall just topped of a good day. We took some photos and Wendy filmed
      us getting covered in snow - there weren’t huge amounts but enough. Funnily
      though within 2 minutes of leaving the snow stopped, it was like it fell just for
      our benefit.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>All the way we
      have been just one step ahead of bad weather; it was almost like it was
      following us just far enough behind for it not to be a problem, but the clouds
      were enough to tell the story.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We had another
      hour or so to get to our destination, which we really wanted to get to before
      night - well we did get there before night at 7:00pm.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>So we went though
      and got our little package which was left out for us, pulled into to sopt 62,
      plugged in and quickly went for a walk to get some KFC as this was pretty much
      all there was, funnily though KFC looked like it was shut as all the chairs
      were stacked on the tables and the place looked like it was actually closed for
      business full stop as there were no staff nor patrons, luckily though were tried
      the door and they were open. After eating inside we walked back in the freezing
      cold to settle in for the night knowing we had another big drive tomorrow, we
      need to make Monument Value by 4:30pm for a booked tour, so the plan is to
      leave by 7:30am. We have gained another hour also which means we will get a
      good night’s sleep, hoping it won't be too cold in the RV. It did get very cold
      down to about 3 degrees.</span></p>

    <h1><a name="_Toc380399349" id="_Toc380399349"><span class="Heading1Char">Day 18 - Thursday 11th
      April Monument Valley</span></a></h1>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We left
      Albuquerque at 7:30am to get a good head start also so as we had a little more
      time to do some stops along the way. We were due at Goulding’s Campground at
      4:30 for a full moon sunset tour of Monument Valley - this was going to be very
      good.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The drive was
      nice and easy and we kept good time the whole way with a few stops along the
      way. First stop was Laguna in New Mexico, we filled up on fuel and got some
      souvenirs - Lilia bought a little Indian doll and Jack got an Indian Arrow,
      both were really nice unique gifts.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>A few hours later
      we stopped on the way to the Arizona border at a very old trading post store,
      they had the most amazing traditional gifts so naturally we bought some things,
      Wendy got some beautiful opal and silver earrings - 2 lots as they were so
      cheap, Jack got a really nice set of small arrows which will go with a little
      crossbow he bought in Fort Worth, Lilia got a little dream catcher and I got a
      couple of little books on the areas we were visiting, as well a few snack and
      other bit.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>This was the best
      stop for souvenirs so far, just excellent and the lady was just so helpful. We
      were much happier spending money here as opposed to a government run tourism
      store so we felt good despite spending quite a bit.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It was now about
      3:00pm and only about 30 more minutes to get to our destination - I was in a
      hurry as my camera battery was very low and i needed it charged for the tour
      later so there was no messing about, full speed ahead. We arrived at 3:30pm
      which had been the plan since we left so we did very well despite some pretty
      poor roads which caused us to reduce speed.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Driving through
      and onto the Monument Valley was just mind blowing, none of us had ever seen
      anything like the changing landscapes, the colors of nature and the awesomeness
      of the various stone monuments around us, we took lots of photos on the way
      only to be totally awestruck when we saw where we were staying. It is just the
      most amazing place and it has to be on everyone’s bucket list. The surrounding
      landscape has so much to offer and i was so keen to get the tour underway, but
      when we had checked in and parked the RV Wendy read up on the tour to ensure we
      could pay by credit as we didn't have enough cash to cover it, we noticed that
      they were expecting a phone call the day before which we obviously just
      couldn't do due to not have a mobile not access to public phones ( there are no
      public phones in the US anymore as they have either been broken or just do not
      exist. We got a little worried and emailed them straight away hoping we would
      still get the tour. Luckily they did see the email and arrived at 5:00pm to
      pick us up.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Our guides name
      was Bobby and was of Navaho decent so was authorised to take us on this special
      tour which only allows a Navaho guide to access the areas of the tour,
      otherwise you cannot enter the park - this is purely to preserve the traditions
      of the land owners. The tour was to be 2.5 hours long and we were all very
      excited. He was driving a big 4 wheel drive and later we learnt why you needed
      it.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The entry to the
      Navaho reserve was about 10 minutes drive and no sooner were we on our way the
      questions i had been thinking of started pouring out, but to no surprise Bobby
      had all the answers. He had some good experience so knew which positions were
      optimum for taking photos and advised me as such when preparing to take shots.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The first
      monuments we saw were called Sentinel Mesa ( Mesa means table top or flats )
      and this was a huge rock formation which basically was totally flat on top, you
      could see the timeline in the various layers of rock and sediment which was
      pretty amazing, all of the area goes back some 160 million years when the area
      was covered in water, the water subsided over the millennia and acids in the
      water carved out certain distinct features. But to be able to see the layers
      and the colors just shows how incredible nature is. The next stop was to see 2
      famous monuments called the Mittens; they truly look like a pair of mittens
      referred to east and west mittens. The day was a little cloudy so we didn't get
      any sunlight which would have highlighted the colors even more and allowed some
      shadows paly as well but the benefit was having neutral light cover which was
      good for exposure.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Next was Camel
      Butte - 3 large spires which did look like camels humps. Then we saw the three
      sisters, the totem pole and then we went to an amazing area with holes in the
      rocks, not little holes but massive holes, all around the holes were natural
      rock with the most amazing colors.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Bobby asked if we
      would like to see and hear some traditional entertainment, we accepted his
      offer and he hooked up with another guide who would sing  a couple of
      traditional Navajo songs and Bobby would play the wooden flute, directly under
      a huge arch which had the most incredible acoustics. The singing was just
      incredible and the young man told us that he and most Navajo children are
      raised by their grandparents, they have such faith in their traditional beliefs
      and upbringing he chose to sing about his grandparents, he was just amazing and
      we found out he has a CD to buy which we plan to do. After this short
      performance which was done just for us whilst we lay back looking up to the
      ceiling of the archway we headed off for some more amazing sights. So far we
      had been gone about 1.5 hours and seen a lot of sights, gone over some really
      rough sand dunes, hence the 4WD, incidentally whilst we were taking photos, he
      got a call from another guide who had gotten himself bogged - so Bobby asked if
      we would mind taking a quick detour to help out - naturally we were happy to
      help him.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We saw some more
      amazing areas where there were again holes in the ceiling of the massive
      structures, and then saw some original petroglyphs dating back to about 1200AD
      as well the remains of some pottery and a small structure which would have been
      a residence for the people of the time.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We were planning
      to head back just as the sun started to peek through the clouds and shone onto
      many of the monuments, so there was time for one last stop to capture the
      lighting, the colors were just amazing, I just cannot imagine that my photos
      will do it justice, despite taking about 600 photos just on this tour.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well the time was
      up as it was nearly 7:30pm and Bobby drove us back to our campground, we gave
      him a nice decent tip and said we would give a good review on Trip Advisor
      which i will do at the earliest chance.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>I also bought
      this beautiful Indian Wooden flute - there were $260 at the campsite but as a
      small trading post we found one for $100, it's still a lot of money but the instrument
      sounds so nice and I’m sure i can belt out a tune after some practise.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>This was the most
      spectacular afternoon and i felt a strange connection to the place.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Back to the RV
      for some dinner.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We are off to the
      Grand Canyon tomorrow. It's a 3.5 hour drive this time which is good as I have
      done some very big drives and it will be nice not to spend so much time
      driving.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>..</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>...</span></p>

    <h1><a name="_Toc380399350" id="_Toc380399350">Day 19 - Friday 12th April Grand Canyon</a></h1>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>I woke up at
      4:00am to go and take some night photos of some monument rocks etc., there
      would be long exposure to capture some late night details otherwise not seen, I
      took about 35 photos and with a minimum 45 second exposure - they look pretty
      nice too.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well back in the
      RV at 5:30am, will have some coffee and wake the other about 7:30am and get
      ready to leave for the Grand Canyon.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well the drive to
      the Grand Canyon was pretty good all round, we were able to stop at a few road
      side Indian store which i had been so looking forward to, but unfortunately the
      bracelets i bought here many years ago were not available, so we just got a few
      dream catchers and arrow heads. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We arrived at the
      Grand Canyon at about 1:00pm and went to a lookout called the watch tower, this
      was built in 1932 by a lady who had far too much money as it's quite a fort, from
      my limited understanding it was not there to server any other purpose other
      than to give an advantageous view point, 360 degree view of the south rim and
      down to the Colorado river. There were heaps of tourists, mostly French who you
      could hear a mile away. We all enjoyed this opportunity and went through the
      gift shops - I got a couple of sew on patches for my collection and then we
      went back to the RV for some corn dogs and hot dogs for lunch.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The next
      viewpoint to stop at was called Moran’s Point, however as we had experienced in
      the past the RV parking was taken up by regular cars which meant we could
      actually stop - this annoys the crap out of me as it just illustrates how rude
      and inconsiderate some people can be. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We continued onto
      the next stop called Kiki Point but you were not allowed to park here as it was
      reserved for tour buses only, this meant that yet again people chose to park
      either side of the entry practically blocking the roadways, so all we could do
      was to get to the camp ground unpack, plug in and go for our own walk.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>After settling in
      we wandered over to the nearest tourist centre and bought a few things, I got a
      book called &quot;Death in the Grand Canyon&quot; - this is about all the
      fatalities which have occurred in The Grand Canyon over the last hundred years
      or so up to and including last year - it is just mind blowing how stupid some
      people are and this book clearly tells the story. Funnily enough when we went
      to walk to the south rim trail the maps were all wrong so we ended up just roughing
      it through the bush, we finally came across the trail close to where we wanted
      to be and proceeded along a paved path to the Moran’s Point which we had tried
      to view on the drive in. There are so many people who totally ignore the rules
      and step right to the edge of a 1000 ft. drop with no regard for the fact that
      they could lose balance, slip or the fact that these million year old limestone
      rocks could give way at any time, kids and adults alike seem to have to regard
      for safety. I was pushing on the kids not to stand on or even near the rails as
      there was too much risk in my mind and it’s just not worth taking that extra
      step up on to a railing to get a slightly better view when you can see just as
      well standing back and well within safe areas. The rail guards only cover small
      portions of the rim as from what i read it would take enough steel to make
      railing to cover the entire rim to go around the entire earth, there are over
      4000 miles of rim walks and apparently it is just not feasible, this is perhaps
      why so many people fall to their death as they can walk right up to the edge
      and pear over extreme drops. It was making me cranky how many people continued
      to be right at the edge despite so many signs encouraging them to stay well
      back. Anyway we continued down the path but to be honest I really couldn't see
      the point in walking to every single lookout as the view was the same, unless
      the time of day has changed significantly then the light is the same and the
      picture people take are very average due to the amount of haze, it's very
      difficult to get beautiful picture unless you prepare yourself either in the
      early morning sunlight or the late afternoon sun when the lighting is at its
      optimum, so based on his i was more inclined to suggest we walk through the
      bush and enjoy what nature had to offer, sounds funny for someone who likes
      taking photos so much but no point if they are going to be substandard.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>So upon walking
      the path we noticed people crowded around a very large moose like animal, turns
      out it was a female &quot;Elk&quot;, I happened to be positions perfectly for
      some very nice photos, when the elk decided to do what many stupid people do
      and walk around the railing very close to the edge, i got some close up photos
      of the elk with the canyon behind it, which i was very happy with. Along the
      way we saw quite a few more elk's and a couple of little &quot;Deer&quot;,
      unfortunately people once again had no respect for wildlife nor the rules set
      out by the park and were touching and feeding the elks, it is mentioned on
      numerous occasions not to go within 6 feet of any wildlife and under no
      circumstances feed them, common sense should have prevailed but not here.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We went back to
      camp and noticed that our neighbours were collecting fire wood, to start a fire
      which was strictly prohibited, I could tell they were going to do it and I
      started talking to the kids about why you are not allowed to do so, it looked
      like for a while that they had heard me and were going to refrain from lighting
      it, that was only short lived as around dusk they lit the fire with no regard
      for the fact that they were in a national park and there were large trees with
      overhanging branches right near us and them, anyway it got the better of me and
      i went and said something to them, I wasn't rude but also not overly friendly
      and i was cross, shortly afterwards they did put out the fire. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well tomorrow we
      need an early start to get on the road to make another long drive to Las Vegas;
      I plan to wake everyone at 7:00am to enable us to leave by 7:30am.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The weather is
      very comfortable so were not expecting any cold nights like we have had over
      the last couple of days.</span></p>

      actually only 6:00am, bugger because I had now been up since 3:30am and knew i
      would later pay the price, no matter it meant that we could take the drive a
      little easier without rushing to get to our destination.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The roads were
      terrible and so bad that it wasn't possible to sit anywhere near the speed
      limit, due to rough surfaces etc., this didn't stop truckies screaming past us
      and these guys had a lot of trouble staying in a straight line whilst doing 130
      kph. There were also no rest stops for the entire 6 hours so it made for a very
      long and tiring drive. We finally stopped after two and a half hours for the
      first time and finally got to stop in at a &quot;Dunkin Doughnuts&quot; which I
      had been longing for since arriving, we got a selection of doughnuts and I bought
      the biggest coffee mug you have ever seen for about $6. After a short rest we
      continued on for the rest of the trip knowing that we most likely won't have
      anywhere to stop until we reach Las Vegas, however we made really good time so
      much so that we had time to stop at Hoover Dam. It had changed an awful lot
      since i was last here, there is a massive big arched bridge that was only built
      in the last few years which you need to drive over whilst travelling the
      highway, not something i remember doing, you can also park and walk across the
      bridge looking down to the dam itself. So we did the walk across and then went
      down and parked to go and walk across the dam and to the visitor centre, we
      bought Lilia a little stuffed cat in basket, Jack got a stuffed Jackalope ( yep
      this is a real animal - highly elusive and quite rare these animals are a cross
      breed between a jack rabbit and an antelope, bred in the 1880's a few escaped
      their enclosures and bred in the wild), and i bought another little book on the
      history and construction of Hoover Dam. It bought back lots of memories and it
      was really worth going. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It was not only
      30 minutes until we would arrive at Las Vegas so much so that you could see it
      in the distance - it's not like the last time I arrived at night-time though
      and you couldn't really tell it was Las Vegas as there were no lights, but
      Wendy could tell it was due to the shape of a few buildings, I wasn't sure to
      be honest but Wendy was right and we finally made it by about 3:00pm.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We had to go straight
      to MGM Grand to pick up tickets for tonight’s Cirque Du Soleil show called
  &quot;KA&quot; which was on at 7:00pm. Getting there in the RV was difficult as
      the lanes were very narrow and we had some very close calls within mm of
      hitting other buses and cars due to our extended side mirrors. We got there in
      time and were then keen to go back to the other end of the Las Vegas strip to
  &quot;Circus Circus&quot; where we were staying. All up the little trip took
      well over an hour due to all the traffic and pedestrians.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>After checking in
      we had a couple of hours to go walking the strip and to get some dinner, but
      first we went via the &quot;Adventure Dome&quot; this is an inside adventure
      park with 25 rides inside Circus Circus, myself and the kids got passes for
      unlimited rides as the place didn't shut until midnight - Jack and I went on
      the world’s biggest indoor double loop and twist roller coaster and then Jack
      and Lilia played some putt putt golf, they had a great time but we needed to
      eat, however getting a meal wasn't what it used to be as the buffet had a
      massive line as did other restaurants we tried to go to. So we walked and
      walked and went to Denny's which was great, no line to wait and the food was
      very cheap and good. But despite enjoying the food we were fast running out of
      time as we needed to get to the end of the strip back to MGM by 6:45pm for our
      show, we made it with minutes to spare after having to deal with Disneyworld
      like crowds and hundreds of people trying to push call girl cards into your
      faces - yep prostitutes are everywhere and you just need to turn a blind eye. I
      remember when we were here in 1981 and dad walked ahead of us the same thing
      happened to him, so nothing has changed in that regard.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We got to the MGM
      and went and took our seats for &quot;KA&quot; we were right in the middle 6
      rows from the front, the best seats we could have hoped for - no doubt again
      due to Wendy's early planning. The show costs a small fortune so I was very
      pleased to see that they treat you very well and even gave both kids cushions
      to sit on so as they could see everything without stretching and sitting
      uncomfortably for the duration of the show. No photos allowed which is
      understandable as you wouldn't do very well in such low light conditions
      anyway, plus there would be a souvenir book available to purchase which we
      would do after the show.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well words cannot
      describe the show; it is absolutely incredible with the most amazing storyline,
      costumes, acrobatics and stage performances I have ever seen. There were times
      that they were performing on a vertical stage - the stage was mechanical and
      could rotated 360 degrees and added to the degree of difficulty that the
      performers all took for granted, they put on a great 90 minute show and the
      crowd was in awe. We all enjoyed it thoroughly.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well it was not
      about 8:30pm. Getting back up the strip was a huge challenge due to the crowds,
      we had hoped to see the Bellagio Fountain show, but we couldn't really get any
      vantage point to see it properly, Lilia was on my shoulders so she could see it
      good but Jack had to try and squeeze though all the big adults blocking his
      view, I took what will likely be pretty crappy photos but it was the best we
      could manage. We also missed out on seeing the Sirens show at Treasure Island
      due to the number of people, but again there wasn't much we could do but walk
      with the crowds for another 7 blocks or so. To make walking the strip worse
      there are many intersections where there is no pedestrian crossing of lights to
      enable crossing the street and many times we were re-routed through hotels and
      up elevators to pass via bridges, this just added to the difficulty in getting
      back. We finally made it back to Circus Circus at about 10:30pm but we needed
      to go back to the theme park to get some money’s worth from the $75 it cost to
      but our unlimited ride passes, we end up going a few more rides and saw a short
      4D movie on SpongeBob Square pants and then Jack and I had 2 games of Laser Tag
      which he enjoyed so much. It was just about midnight now and the park was due
      to close shortly so we went back to get some much deserved sleep. It was quite
      a warm night too but was confortable.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>I got up at
      6:00am so as I could go to the casino to do a little gambling, I won a huge $10
      but quit playing shortly after losing it again very quickly, it was just a bit
      of fun for me, I went for a quick stroll got a coffee and a doughnut and went
      back to wake the family as it was not about 7:30am and time to get up. Wendy
      had just woken but we let the kids sleep a little bit longer.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We are going to
      be heading up to San Francisco today, it will be too long a drive to get there
      in one day so we will likely stop at Kettleman City which is about a 6 hour
      drive, we don't have any deadline so we can take it a little easier than
      normal. Only a few more days to go now.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We plan to leave
      at about 9:00 and should arrive at our stopover about 4:30 pm with allowance
      for a couple of stops.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>I got up at
      6:00am to go to the casino just to have a quick go, I only took $20 to play
      with and pretty much lost it all, I won $10 at the end and called it quits
      after such a big win, bought a coffee and Krispy crème. I wandered around the
      streets for 30 minutes before heading back to wake the family.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We got up and
      went to have the breakfast buffet at Circus Circus, it cost about $50 for all
      of us but we had a good breaky and were ready for another long drive. I
      actually had 2 servings of bacon, eggs and sausages then 4 pancakes and then
      finally some doughnuts, Jack had bacon and eggs, scrambled eggs, french toast
      and some other stuff, Lilia had peaches and yogurt whilst Wendy had bacon and
      eggs and then a bagel with salmon and sour cream. We all enjoyed it and headed
      back to the RV as we needed to get going. By the time we were ready it was just
      about 11:00am - time for check out anyway. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We headed out of
      town and said goodbye to Las Vegas - city of sin.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>First stop was to
      get fuel, as we approached the service station we saw signs saying that there
      were massive delays on the highway, there wasn't much we could do as it was
      pretty much the only route. When we got fuel the guy inside said the highway
      was closed due to grass fires, but because we saw everyone else going that way
      we decided to continue and ignore the warnings as the only suggested route
      would have been to back track via Las Vegas to Hoover Dam and then to come down
      the other side of Las Vegas, all in all it would have taken over an hour so we
      continued down the highway. Not too long and the traffic came to a standstill
      all 3 lanes were stuck and we could see for miles the cars waiting, there was
      no turning back no though, but we couldn't determine what the cause may have
      been whether it was traffic accidents or fires as we were cautioned about. Well
      we were stuck for over an hour and during this time there were so many cars
      which pulled into the emergency lane or worse still went off road and down the
      side of the road via the dirt tracks, on a few occasions we saw the same cars
      being overtaken by the slow moving traffic, but it was really annoying as they
      were all just trying to cut the traffic which everyone had to put up to.
      Finally we got through it and with great surprise we saw that the police had
      caught many of the short cutters.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well it looked
      pretty dismal ahead, very dark and most likely was dust from the Death Valley
      area, renowned for its wicked dust storms. It sure was a dust storm so much so
      that the wind was similar to what we experienced in Texas that horrible night
      when we got snowed in, and the visibility was down to about 50 feet.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>After yet again
      struggling to keep the RV in a straight line due to such immense winds we had
      no option but to pull over in a rest area, the wind and dust was just
      incredible and the most amazing dust storm we had ever seen or heard of. After
      asking some locals we were told that this was very uncommon and it could
      continue for hours or days, we couldn't wait as we felt very unsafe with the
      howling winds and dust - the dust was so strong it would sting your legs when trying
      to walk outside.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We proceeded with
      great caution and decided we would have to stop at the nearest town - the town
      was Mojave famous for its desserts. Funnily enough this is where Richard
      Branson launched his first intergalactic space flight some months earlier as we
      later found out when we went for dinner at a place called Jack in the box. We
      got talking to one fellow who was interested in our accents, when we started
      talking the whole restaurant stopped to listen to us chat, just prior the place
      was a hive of talking with families and others chatting, but the place fell
      silent when we were talking to this guy who had heard of Australia only through
      TV, they obviously hadn't had many if any Aussie here before, it was like a
      small ghost town so fair enough i guess.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well we stayed at
      a little Inn called Executive Inn; it was reasonably priced but had a bit of a
      smell about it, probably due to not having any guests stay here for a while.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Outside when
      looking towards the mountains there were wind farms extending as far as the eye
      could see, presumably they take advantage of the massive winds that seem
      apparent all the time. We enjoyed dinner and each had a hot bath to freshen up
      before getting an early night, it would be a very early start tomorrow as we needed
      to make up a few hours due to the storm today.</span></p>

    <h1><a name="_Toc380399353" id="#Day22"><span class="Heading1Char">Day 22 - Monday 15th April  San Francisco</span></a></h1>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We left Mojave at
      about 7:00am and headed for San Francisco - it would be a 5 hour drive and we
      needed to see Muir Woods National Park before closing and do sightseeing of San
      Francisco, so there was no time to stay put and enjoy the freezing cold
      conditions. On our way we still experienced extreme winds which we would later
      discover was not normal. Along the way we saw more wind farms going hell for
      leather, some didn't move at all but most were going so fast we could tell
      there were significant winds about, this yet again caused the driving to be
      less than ideal and the RV once again was difficult to keep in a straight line.
      We stopped for fuel twice on the way the 2nd time we had brunch at a place
      called Fosters - burgers and shakes, we each had a burger and settled out empty
      stomachs. We drove through a lot of very picturesque area mostly farms of
      Almond trees and flowers. It was now about 12:00pm and we only had another hour
      or so to arrive on the outskirts of San Francisco. The traffic started to
      increase significantly which told us we were certainly getting close, despite
      the GPS sending us on a bit of a run around. We needed to back track just a
      little way to get us back on the right highway but did so without too much
      difficulty. Once we arrived on the edge of the city we could see San Francisco
      in all its glory, the tall buildings stood proud as did 2 fabulous bridges -
      neither of which were the famed Golden Gate - well not just yet anyway. Within
      minutes we got our first glimpse of the Golden Gate Bridge which Lilia
      appropriately named the Red Bridge. We had to drive very carefully as the roads
      were extremely narrow and definitely not designed for RV's, so much so that
      both side mirrors over hung both side lines and was a little scary to say the
      least, what made things worse was the huge winds which just kept thrashing us
      about, something which I was getting more accustomed to each time we
      experienced it. We drove through the tight roads seemingly being the only RV in
      the city - as Wendy pointed out it would be like driving a huge RV through the
      little back streets of Sydney city - it just isn't something we would do not
      expect to see but what choice did we really have. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We proceeded to
      find parking and entered a parking lot within a few blocks of Pier 39 at
      Fishermen’s Wharf, this spot was chosen by me as I happened to see a lone RV
      parked within the car park, well it turns out that we could enter but we couldn't
      find parking nor could we exit due to the number of cars parks and the tight
      space in which you could manoeuvre the vehicle, this turned out to be a bad
      decision on my behalf but we were pretty much stuck, so i carefully positioned
      ourselves in a handicapped zone and took up two spaces just to fit the RV, we
      paid $40 to stop there and figured we had better just stay put and hopefully
      when we return there would be some cars that had moved enabling us to get out
      of the sardine can we were in. The wind was absolutely howling and it felt like
      minus 10 but we proceeded to walk down to the main Pier and see the sights. 1
      Day is definitely not enough, well 3 hours anyway to see San Francisco as it
      needs a good couple of days to wander about leisure and see everything. But we
      made use of our time and walked up Lombard Street to view the crooked street
      from afar, the closest we could get in the timeframe we had but the kids could
      see it and were pleased anyway. A few more blocks away was Fishermen’s wharf
      which we walked to; the crowds were amazing as this must be the number one
      tourist spot. We saw plenty of new and older cable cars which was again a bit
      of a novelty and fun to see, however catching one was out of the question as
      you needed to have exact coinage for each passenger, that meant $8 in quarters
      which we just didn't have. After some wandering of the shops and buying some
      souvenirs and a couple of books we continued to enjoy the various shops and the
      kids had a go on a beautiful old merry go round. Wendy was lucky enough to find
      a lovely charm for her Pandora bracelet of a San Francisco cable car also which
      was lucky. We walked to the end of the pier and overlooked Alcatraz Island but
      we could only view it for a short time as the wind was just incredible and made
      the temperature very uncomfortable. Jack bought some fish and calamari, we got
      a couple more squashed pennies for the kid’s collections - these are available
      pretty much everywhere as good little souvenirs, they each have a special
      little wallet in which to keep and display them also.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We were aware of
      the time and needed to get going soon to allow us sufficient time to get to and
      enjoy Muir woods - it was only about 40 minutes away but we had to get back to
      the RV, get the RV out of the tight parking and then navigate the streets of
      San Francisco without hitting anything along the way. After clearing the way we
      were back on track and about to drive across the Golden Gate Bridge. It sure is
      a marvel to see and is absolutely beautiful and so big, driving across was a
      little hairy as the winds was just carving it up and the bridge itself was
      swaying happily. With 10 lanes of traffic the bridge was full to capacity so
      there wasn't much room for error if any, but i carefully got us across whilst
      the family enjoyed looking about, i unfortunately didn't really get to see much
      as i had my eagle eyes hones in perfectly on the white lines either side of the
      RV so as not to stray. Getting across was a bit of a relief and we could then
      concentrate on getting to the Muir Woods National Park - this is where the huge
      redwood trees are. I seems to think that i had been here as a young boy but I
      am actually not too sue as I remember driving through or seeing cars drive
      through the base of a huge tree. We arrived at the start of the entry to Muir
      Woods only to see a few warning about taking campers and large vehicles -
      neither of which was recommended, we would soon find out that this is a very
      tight and curvy patch of road which has significant drops either side of the
      road and was very scary to drive, most of the time i was doing 10 - 15 mph hour
      and had to take extreme caution not to plummet over the side, needless to say
      Wendy was not real happy with the road and was pretty much beside herself the
      whole drive. It was about a 20 minute drive and we even missed the turn and now
      had to somehow do a u turn on these tight roads to get back, i was able to do
      so after a few minutes and then needed to make a very sharp turn in order to
      get through the entry. It was one hell of a drive that I will never forget.
      Well we made it down the mountain and entered the park only to find out that
      there was no parking for RV's and all the spots had been taken by small cars,
      this was hugely frustrating as we needed to drive about a mile out of the park
      only to walk back, despite being told by 2 park rangers that we could park in
      the bus zone, when we tried to another park ranger lady said we were not
      allowed, what made this more frustrating was that there were cars which had
      done exactly what were not allowed to do despite having already paid our park
      entry fees.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well anyway we
      were in no position to argue and finally found a spot some 5 minutes away. We
      walked back via a nice path and entered into the park only to be overwhelmed by
      the large trees and the expansiveness of this particular forest, it was truly
      spectacular. We stopped by the gift shop and bought the obligatory souvenirs
      and continued walking through some tracks, we got lots of excellent photos many
      of which the kids were able to stand in or around some of the largest trees we
      had ever seen. Well it was now about 5:00pm and we needed to get going so as to
      find out RV Park in a place called Marin City - this was on the other side of
      the San Francisco and only about 15 minutes drive. We fortunately had another
      route to take so as to avoid the treacherous roads we took when we arrived and
      it was a little better. We made it to Marin City but the RV park office was
      already closed but had fortunately left a RV number for us to pull into and
      prepare for the night ahead, it was cold and we expected it to be a freezing
      cold night but wasn't so bad after all. We had attempted to walk around and
      find something to eat, but after 30 minutes of walking in the freezing
      conditions we gave up and headed back to the RV to eat what we had leftover in
      the fridge, Pizza, Egg Rolls, Hot Dogs and Corn Dogs, luckily we did have some
      food available as we were all starving.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Lilia and I
      played her 1 Direction game until about 9:00pm and Jack watched a video, at
      about 9:30pm they were all fast asleep and i did a little reading.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Tomorrow we plan
      to leave nice and early to get through to San Francisco to get some photos of
      the Golden Gate before peak hour traffic starts so it will be an early start.
      We will then head to San Jose to tour the Winchester Mystery House.</span></p>

      photos of the bay area and the bridge spanning the bay all in nice time however
      it took 3 hours to get to San Jose which should have been an hour drive, all
      due to peak hour traffic. When we arrived at Winchester Mystery House they let
      us delay our tour for 30 minutes so as we could get something to eat and drink
      first. The memories of this place are a little different, i seem to remember
      that there were a lot more land or at least house property, as it stands today
      there is hardly any land surrounding the actual house and it is taken up with
      shops and cinemas, perhaps it was the same but it was so long ago i can't fully
      remember, I asked one of the staff and it was in and around 1980 when they sold
      a lot of the land to the government, so perhaps my memory wasn't too far off.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We had 2 tours to
      do today, a standard house tour as well as a special behind the scenes tour.
      The gardens and outside of the house are the only places where taking photos
      are permitted so naturally i took plenty of photos. Just prior to entering the
      house for the first tour at 10:00am we bought a couple of squashed pennies and
      looked around at a little firearms museum and we were ready for the tour. Upon
      entering they take a family photo, not that we were going to purchase it but
      Jack and Lilia stood in front of Wendy and I whilst the kids held a Winchester
      rifle each, but we were dressed liked camper travellers and the photo wouldn't
      have been up to scratch. We entered through the carriage doors which was where
      Sarah Winchester used to have her horse drawn carriage drive into the actual
      house to avoid poor weather, they asked us to refrain from photos and to hand
      over my newly purchased super-size Winchester Coffee travel mug, which i did
      knowing i would get it upon exiting the tour. We had a young girl called Shay
      who had only done a handful of tours but knew her stuff, i came to know quite a
      bit about this place as i had done huge amounts of research out of interest
      prior to leaving Sydney and she was on the mark. We walked through the house
      for about 60 minutes and lagged behind a few times as i just needed to take a
      few photos despite the rules, although i knew i would later buy a book which
      would cover of the photographic needs i sought. There seemed to be more places
      which were restricted now and everything was cut off from tourists behind red
      velvet lines. However it was truly an amazing place and story. After the house
      tour we were scheduled to go on the behind the scenes and garden tour which
      took us to places only opened to the public some years ago, definitely worth
      doing as i had read a lot about it. We had a nice young man called Donald who
      had a lot of great jokes along the way and specifically included Jack and Lilia
      and Jack even participated in telling a few jokes along the way. We got to see
      all the outhouses including the garage, fruit drying barn, water shed and then
      the most exciting was going into the basement. The basement was particularly
      interesting as they used to import coal from Australia as it was the cheapest
      option. Sarah Winchester was very innovative as they had their own Gas
      Producing plant, Boiler and electricity which were generated by 3 different
      means. The gardens held a lot of significance also which were truly amazing and
      kept in perfect condition. The house begun tours within a month of Sarah's
      death in 1922 and some years later was purchased by a local business however we
      don’t get told nor is there any information as to who bought and manages it.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well it was time
      to visit the gift shop again to make our purchases, of which we bought a book,
      patch and DVD on the house and its secrets.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Unfortunately
      Wendy was getting really crook as a migraine was coming on, so we went back to
      the RV for her to rest a while and Lilia and I went to find some lunch.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>This surrounding
      area is like the richest place and everything was designer, including the
      burger joints. Jack wanted just a cheeseburger but they cost $10 each, Lilia
      only wanted a smoothie but we couldn't get one so she settled for a milkshake
      whilst we bought Wendy a subway roll, all up this little lunch time adventure
      cost nearly $50.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>When me and Lilia
      got back Wendy’s condition had only gotten much worse to the point where we
      couldn't drive anywhere and had to stay put for nearly 3 hours, this obviously
      wasn't ideal for hew not our schedule to get back to our LA hotel by tonight.
      At about 3:00pm we drove for a while but i could tell Wendy wasn't very well
      and found a pharmacy to get some tablets and medicine to help her, this however
      meant we were stuck in the parking lot for another good couple of hours, by
      which time it was nearly 6:00pm and there was just no way we could make it to
      LA tonight. So i looked for the nearest RV Park on the way south and it was
      just about an hour away. After Wendy had settled sufficiently for us to drive
      we drove to Los Banos which was on highway 5 and at least heading in the right
      direction to LA but still 5 hours away. We pulled in to a Motel 6 where Wendy
      would have been able to have a hot bath and try to fully recover. Despite
      changing plans to stay at a motel instead of the RV Park the place didn't have
      bath plugs so we had to dodge something up to allow her to have a soak. After
      unpacking just what we needed for the night Jack and I went to get some dinner
      at a place called the Iron Skillet, it is just the most amazing place with
      restaurant, gift shop, truck stop, games room, cinema for those weary truck
      drivers etc., we ordered the best meals and took them back to the room. It
      worked out the best way it could have under the circumstances.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Let’s hope Wendy
      is feeling better in the morning. Funnily enough Wendy and Lilia both had
      strange experiences with the Séance room at Winchester House, Wendy suddenly
      felt the room move and saw a man’s figure on the roof and Lilia though she had
      seen a ghost also, both told their stories at different times and i don't
      believe either were influenced by the other, strange, very strange. This is
      also when Wendy's headaches started to occur. She isn't too keen to ever visit
      again but Lilia would like to live there.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>

      April  Back to LA attempt 2</span></a></h1>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>It is now 7:00am
      and the kids and Wendy are still asleep although it appears Wendy has recovered
      and we should be heading off soon. We have a 5 hour drive ahead of us and
      unfortunately we must get back tonight as we leave US tomorrow, so fingers
      crossed for an easy wind free drive.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Its 1:06pm and
      because we were so short of time I ignored what 'Missy' was telling me ( More
      about Missy shortly...) and went at about 80mph for most of the trip, the roads
      were in poor condition, more so on the far right lane as this is the designated
      truck lane so it cops a lot of traffic. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>'Missy' is our
      GPS we had to name her as she was a bit of a dummy, she had a tendency to get
      her left and right correct, as well it was common for her to send us not only
      on a wild goose chase but in circles, just repeating the same circular track
      for ages. Anyway that’s Missy.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>When we were
      trying to enter the address for the hotel it wouldn't accept the exact address
      number, often we would try to redefine the exact destination when we were
      closer, however this time we ended up going down to a cold-e-sac and
      construction all around full with truck and cement mixers in the street I was
      stuck. A guy in a huge Ute needed to get out, i reversed as far as I could to
      let him get out and do the required 75 point turn. Now this enabled me an
      opportunity to use his space to get in a nice 24 point turn instead. Sure
      enough we got out and drove straight ahead and just had to cross the road and
      we could see the hotel on the right, easy.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Ok we got across
      the road ok but this hotel is not our Cockatoo, ours was further down and on
      the left. Ok last 3 point turn to do then we are home free, got down to our
      hotel ok but they don't have parking, so not direct access to our room as we
      had expected. So we get to the Cockatoo Inn hotel at about 1:25pm, we had
      pre-arranged this room for last night and tonight so as we had somewhere to
      unload the RV, pack and all the other things that needed to be done, whilst
      also waiting until 7:00pm when we have a shuttle bus taking us to LAX.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>So after
      struggling to temporarily and quickly unpack the RV, so as to even allow us to
      get into the room, we packed everything we had into plastic souvenir store bags
      and made post haste for the room. We loaded the hotels one and only trolley
      with bag upon bag. It really looked like i was moving enough stuff for 3
      families not just 1.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We sure had a lot
      of stuff and I couldn’t even take a photo. Up to the room we unload everything
      and now the rush is on to get the RV back.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>So we didn't have
      time to wash the RV, not dump the tanks, nor fill the gas, clean the inside
      properly (it was kept clean daily but it's not like you could vacuum the place
      as you went) and just a while ago Jack and Lilia managed to break off
      completely a door which had come unhinged during the trip. Crikey Moses, it was
      madness.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>I had kept the
      screws for the dislodged hinge throughout the trip and used these to push back
      into the hinges to get the door looking like it was ok, upon close inspection
      though you can see that two of the four hinges have snapped, this was a door
      without handles as it covered some piping only, so it was never even meant to
      be opened. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We set Missy for
      her last chore 22335 E 223rd, easy right, well you have got to be kidding
      trying to get here was a battle and a half - turn of highway 105 down 190Th /
      Carson E???? That was typical of the instructions we would be given - I gave up
      going the wrong way and rung the RV place and we were told we were just a block
      parallel to them...well that was a crock. It took us another 10 minutes to find
      them as 1 block here must mean each block consisting of a suburb each. Finally
      got there and Wendy was emotional as it had been quite trying in getting here
      and she just needed to let it out, it was good timing as the first guy to
      inspect the vehicle saw Wendy and could see she was upset and basically quickly
      looked inside and gave us the go ahead - no checking, no tank level testing
      nothing.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>I went and
      settled the bill, I was even honest enough to tell them what we had no time to
      get done and would accept the charges incurred.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>They tried to hit
      us $171.00 for a TAX we had pre-paid but I discussed it with them and they came
      to agree with me. They were convinced that we could not have paid tax as the
      different states in which we drove had different percentages and therefore it
      is always paid at the end so as it could be calculated based on the state
      variables, however they were accepting the originally quoted total, so I said
      if you have no intention to recalculate what was the point of the whole
      discussion, assume we have paid, when and if we cannot produce our receipt (
      which we had back home as this was paid for a month before we even left AU )
      then charge us. They refunded the whole $500 security deposit and we could
      leave, they had a taxi there waiting for us. The taxi driver took us to
      Wal-Mart.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We had to by
      extra luggage to fit in everything, we bought 2 whole sets of 5 and arranged
      another taxi to get us back to the hotel, the taxi arrived within a few minute
      and we wanted to pay by VISA but his machine was broken, Wendy had only just
      tried to get cash out inside Wal-Mart via an ATM but she couldn't work it. The
      taxi driver offered to help Wendy use the ATM; he couldn't figure it out either
      so drove us to the nearest ATM to get cash out. He was very nice and talkative
      and was kind enough not to start his meter until after getting the cash out. We
      got back to our hotel and gave him a nice $10 tip as he deserved it.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Quickly to the
      room as Wendy (no way I’m going to try) needed to pack, i offered to go and get
      some dinner. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well the luggage
      fitted finally, but I put money on it that my two carry-on bags would have
      weighed more than our big ones, they were jam packed; mostly due to all the
      books Wendy kept on buying.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Well to our
      surprise our shuttle bus was downstairs unloading his last drop offs, David was
      from Mexico and was one of those nice guys but he couldn’t take us on that bus
      because it had to go to the mechanics. So he was getting another bus and
      arrived back a short time later, he opened the back door ready for me to start
      loading and there was this great big bus door lying where the luggage was to
      go. I helped him move this door over to the block where cars were parking as
      guests, we dumped it and came back and loaded all 12 suitcases, done now we
      just had to get to the airport within 3 hours and we would be fine. 20 minutes
      later we were loading the bags on two trolleys and went to check-in, nice and
      early no crowds everything was now down to the weight of our bags, excess
      charges would be highly likely we thought and had prepared ourselves for this, well
      the bags were just under weight limits and we got our boarding passes just like
      normal, phew. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The plane type
      was changed to a 747 instead of a 380, so based on our very original plans and
      tickets, the plane had now changed 3 times, which meant that our original
      awesome seats now became standard 4 row squashed seating. Plane was leaving at
      10:30pm and would be in the air for 14 hours. Kids played games whilst we
      waited, and as usual upon boarding, parents with children are offered early
      boarding precedence.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Kids get offered
      their meals first and not long after we had taken off</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>the kids watched
      some TV a movie or played games on the headrest entertainment system. Within
      minutes of having a little to eat the kids were falling asleep, Lilia nodded of
      pretty much for most of the trip and occasionally stretched out across me to
      get a little more comfy, whilst poor jack was restless and couldn’t get comfy
      for hours, he eventually nodded of but he was already too big and just couldn’t
      get into a position the settled him, he was stretched out across me competing
      with leg space with Lilia. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Wendy got patches
      of sleep despite not being very comfortable either but I struggled to get any
      sleep the whole time, Jack head was overhanging his armrest and every time a person
      or worse a trolley would come by I had to stick my hand over his noggin to stop
      it from getting hit, it was making me laugh.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>We have landed at
      6:30am it is now Friday and we left on Wednesday night, it sure feels like
      Thursday but we don’t get one.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Wendy and I are
      feeling very jet lagged.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>The shuttle bus
      will not be here to pick us up, so we hire a car to get us home which we will
      return this afternoon to Richmond.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;'>Holiday
      officially over.</span></p>
