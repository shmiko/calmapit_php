Expedia-Hotel-Search-PHP-Wrapper-Classes

=====================================

I got a project that need to use Expedia Wrapper for PHP. I think Github is best place to do that.

Eventually, I would like to create a wordpress plugin out of it. but at the moment. Its good to have a class and few functions that can be re-used.
