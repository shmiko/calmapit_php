GeoEvents
=======

#### Geographic Event tracking and data management system ####

GeoEvents is a geographic-oriented knowledge management platform that gives users a common operational picture for tracking events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, etc.  The tasking elements of [GeoQ]  (https://github.com/ngageoint/geoq) work well with the organizational functionality of GeoEvents.    

The GeoEvents software was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with [The MITRE Corporation] (http://www.mitre.org).  The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the [MIT] (http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license.  

###Pull Requests
If you'd like to contribute to this project, please make a pull request. We'll review the pull request and discuss the changes. All pull request contributions to this project will be released under the MIT license.  

Software source code previously released under an open source license and then modified by NGA staff is considered a "joint work" (see 17 USC ยง 101); it is partially copyrighted, partially public domain, and as a whole is protected by the copyrights of the non-government authors and must be released according to the terms of the original open source license.
 
###In the News###
NGA Director Letitia Long talks about NGA's GitHub initiative and our first offerings, GeoQ and GeoEvents, at the GEOINT Symposium.  Her comments start at 40 minutes and 40 seconds in the [video clip] (http://geointv.com/archive/geoint-2013-keynote-letitia-a-long/).

Installation
============

Cloud Installation::

1. You can optionally deploy geoevents with all dependencies to a Virtual Machine or a cloud VM (such as an Amazon Web Services EC2 box) by using the chef installer at [https://github.com/ngageoint/geoevents-chef-installer](https://github.com/ngageoint/geoevents-chef-installer)

2. Chef scripts are our preferred method of automating cloud builds


Mac OSX Development Build Instructions (about 1 hour total)::

    For older macs, Install XCode, update to latest, From Preferences->Downloads, install command line tools (or will get clang errors)

    (open terminal window)
    sudo easy_install pip
    Download Postgres.app (google it. After installing, run it - should see an Elephant icon on the toolbar)
    sudo pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv geoevents_dev
    add to: ~/.bash_login:
        export PATH=/Applications/Postgres93.app/Contents/MacOS/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin:$PATH
        export PGHOST=localhost
        export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/X11/lib"
        export CFLAGS="-I/usr/X11/include -I/usr/X11/include/freetype2 -I/usr/X11/include/libpng12"

        source geoevents_dev/bin/activate
    (close terminal, open new one)

    pip install psycopg2  (Note that some distros e.g. Debian might need it installed via: sudo apt-get build-dep python-psycopg2)
    pip install numpy
    install homebrew (from terminal):
        ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go/install)"

    brew install postgis
    brew install gdal (probably already installed)
    brew install libgeoip
